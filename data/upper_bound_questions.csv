We will show that $p=0$ or $q=0$. Consider the line $y=(q-p) x+p$ passing through $(0, p)$ and $(1, q)$; the latter are two points the line under consideration and the cubic $y^{2}=x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d$ share. Hence the two must share a third point whose $x$-coordinate is the third root of the polynomial $t^{3}+\\left(b-(q-p)^{2}\\right) t^{2}+(c-2(q-p) p) t+\\left(d-p^{2}\\right)$ (it may well happen that this third point coincide with one of the other two points the line and the cubic share).\n\n\n\nNotice that the sum of the three roots is $(q-p)^{2}-b$, so the third intersection has integral $x$-coordinate $X=(q-p)^{2}-b-1$. Its $y$-coordinate $Y=(q-p) X+p$ is also an integer, and hence $a_{X}=X^{3}+b X^{2}+c X+d=Y^{2}$ is a square.

Since $(q-p)^{2}$ and $(q+p)^{2}$ have the same parity, they must be equal, and hence $p q=0$, as desired.\n\n\n\nIt remains to show that such sequences exist, say when $p=0$. Consider the sequence $a_{n}=$ $n^{3}+\\left(q^{2}-2\\right) n^{2}+n$, chosen to satisfy $a_{0}=0$ and $a_{1}=q^{2}$. We will show that when $q=1$, the only square terms of the sequence are $a_{0}=0$ and $a_{1}=1$. Indeed, suppose that $a_{n}=n\\left(n^{2}-n+1\\right)$ is square. Since the second factor is positive, and the two factors are coprime, both must be squares; in particular, $n \\geq 0$. The case $n=0$ is clear, so let $n \\geq 1$. Finally, if $n>1$, then $(n-1)^{2}<n^{2}-n+1<n^{2}$, so $n^{2}-n+1$ is not a square.

Say that two checkpoints are linked by some company if one can start from the lower checkpoint and reach the higher one by using one or more cars of that company (no movement on foot is allowed).

To this end, we assume that there exists a good collection $T$ of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$, and then bound $n$ from above.\n\nTake $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $t=4+2 \\varepsilon$.\n\nClaim. There exists a positive constant $\\sigma=\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$ such that any triangle $\\Delta$ with perimeter $2 s \\geqslant 4+2 \\varepsilon$, inscribed in $\\omega$, has area $S(\\Delta)$ at least $\\sigma$.\n\nProof. Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths of $\\Delta$. Since $\\Delta$ is inscribed in $\\omega$, each side has length at most 2. Therefore, $s-a \\geqslant(2+\\varepsilon)-2=\\varepsilon$. Similarly, $s-b \\geqslant \\varepsilon$ and $s-c \\geqslant \\varepsilon$. By Heron's formula, $S(\\Delta)=\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \\geqslant \\sqrt{(2+\\varepsilon) \\varepsilon^{3}}$. Thus we can set $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)=\\sqrt{(2+\\varepsilon) \\varepsilon^{3}}$.\n\nNow we see that the total area $S$ of all triangles from $T$ is at least $n \\sigma(\\varepsilon)$. On the other hand, $S$ does not exceed the area of the disk bounded by $\\omega$.

(For example, the digits 4 and 1 can be arranged as 41 or 14 .) We then place the leftmost digit in such an arrangement as the leftmost digit of the $n$-digit integer (which must be nonzero) and choose the positions for the remaining non-zero digits among the remaining $n-1$ positions; we call the number of ways of doing this $b$. (For example, for the arrangement 14 , the digit 1 is in the leftmost position and the digit 4 can be in any of the remaining $n-1$ positions.) We fill the rest of the positions with 0s. The number of possible integers in each case will be $a b$, since this method will create all such integers and for each of the $a$ arrangements of the non-zero digits, there will be $b$ ways of arranging the digits after the first one.

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 .
