4,1606,Combinatorics,"Xenia and Sergey play the following game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000. Then she fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. By a move, Sergey tells Xenia a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20 , and she tells him back the set $\left\{a_{k}: k \in S\right\}$ without spelling out which number corresponds to which index. How many moves does Sergey need to determine for sure the number Xenia thought of?","[""Sergey can determine Xenia's number in 2 but not fewer moves.\n\n\n\nWe first show that 2 moves are sufficient. Let Sergey provide the set $\\{17,18\\}$ on his first move, and the set $\\{18,19\\}$ on the second move. In Xenia's two responses, exactly one number occurs twice, namely, $a_{18}$. Thus, Sergey is able to identify $a_{17}, a_{18}$, and $a_{19}$, and thence the residue of $N$ modulo $17 \\cdot 18 \\cdot 19=5814>5000$, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This means that the given range contains a single number satisfying all congruences, and Sergey achieves his goal.\n\n\n\nTo show that 1 move is not sufficient, let $M=\\operatorname{lcm}(1,2, \\ldots, 10)=2^{3} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7=2520$. Notice that $M$ is divisible by the greatest common divisor of every pair of distinct positive integers not exceeding 20. Let Sergey provide the set $S=\\left\\{s_{1}, s_{2}, \\ldots, s_{k}\\right\\}$. We show that there exist pairwise distinct positive integers $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{k}$ such that $1 \\equiv b_{i}\\left(\\bmod s_{i}\\right)$ and $M+1 \\equiv b_{i-1}\\left(\\bmod s_{i}\\right)$ (indices are reduced modulo $k$ ). Thus, if in response Xenia provides the set $\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\right\\}$, then Sergey will be unable to distinguish 1 from $M+1$, as desired.\n\n\n\nTo this end, notice that, for each $i$, the numbers of the form $1+m s_{i}, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, cover all residues modulo $s_{i+1}$ which are congruent to $1(\\equiv M+1)$ modulo $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(s_{i}, s_{i+1}\\right) \\mid M$. Xenia can therefore choose a positive integer $b_{i}$ such that $b_{i} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod s_{i}\\right)$ and $b_{i} \\equiv M+1\\left(\\bmod s_{i+1}\\right)$.

Since the open interval $\\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}\\right)$ isolates $t_{i}$ from the other $t_{j}$, its length, $t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}$, is less than $\\lambda$. Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$.

Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range.

Note. A subset $A$ of $X$ is proper if $A \neq X$. The sets in a collection are assumed to be distinct. The whole collection is assumed to be a subcollection.","[""The required maximum is $2 n-2$.

If $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\}$, then $C$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{T}$ containing $x$ which is impossible. Therefore, there exists $P \\in \\mathcal{T} \\backslash(\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\})$. By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.

Thus $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right|+2 \\leq 2 n-2$, as required.', 'We provide yet another proof of the estimate $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq 2 n-2$.

Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. (Notice that if $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, then $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{x}$ and $y \\in B_{x}$, so $B_{x}=A_{x}$.)\n\n\n\nWe claim that the collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is also good. Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal. As we have mentioned before, there exists an element $y \\in X$ belonging to a unique member (namely, $B_{x}$ ) of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{y}$; also, $B_{y} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{y} \\backslash \\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus we get $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{y}\\right| \\geq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$, which by the maximality assumption yields the equality, which in turn means that $\\mathcal{B}_{y}=\\left(\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}\\right) \\cup\\left\\{B_{y}\\right\\}$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, each set in $\\mathcal{B} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}, B_{y}\\right\\}$ contains either both $x$ and $y$, or none of them.

Determine the smallest possible degree of $f$.","[""The smallest possible degree is $2 n$. In what follows, we will frequently write $A_{i}=$ $\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$, and abbreviate $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}, \\ldots, x_{2 n}, y_{2 n}\\right)$ to $P\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ or as a function of any $2 n$ points.\n\n\n\nSuppose that $f$ is valid. First, we note a key property:\n\n\n\nClaim (Sign of $f$ ). $f$ attains wither only nonnegative values, or only nonpositive values.\n\n\n\nProof. This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for showing $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_0905c833b86511df24f6g-1.jpg?height=1285&width=831&top_left_y=885&top_left_x=1089)\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. Finally, the centroid-shifting trick gives a polynomial which works in general, as wanted.""]",['$2n$'],False,,Expression,,Open-ended_Questions,RMM/2023,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,116.31244213291639,RMM/2023-2

A fictitious domino is good if it is completely covered by a domino in the arrangement; otherwise, it is bad.\n\n\n\nIf the fictitious dominoes are all good, then the dominoes in the arrangement that cover no fictitious domino, if any, all lie in two triangular regions of side-length $m-1$ at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the board.

If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes.

Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$.

Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty. Thus, the number of dominoes in $R$ is at most $(w-d+j)-(j-i)=w-(d-i)$, so $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells, as we wanted to show.""]",['$m n-\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$'],False,,Expression,,Open-ended_Questions,RMM/2016,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,115.97227678602624,RMM/2016-2

Then $\\operatorname{deg} P \\geq k n$.\n\nProof. We use induction on $k$. The base case $k=0$ is clear since $P \\neq 0$. Denote for clarity $y=x_{k}$.\n\nLet $R\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)$ be the residue of $P$ modulo $Q(y)=y(y-1) \\ldots(y-n)$.

Substituting $x_{i}=a_{i}$ into $R\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)$, we get a polynomial in $y$ which vanishes at all points $y=0, \\ldots, n$ and has degree $\\leq n$. Therefore, this polynomial is null, hence $R_{i}\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}\\right)=0$ for all $i=0,1, \\ldots, n$. In particular, $R_{n}\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}\\right)=0$.\n\nThus, the polynomial $R_{n}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right)$ satisfies the condition of the induction hypothesis.

In the sequel, the word collision will be used to denote meeting of exactly two ants, moving in opposite directions.\n\nIf at the beginning we place an ant on the southwest corner square facing east and an ant on the southeast corner square facing west, then they will meet in the middle of the bottom row at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}$. After the collision, the ant that moves to the north will stay on the board for another $m-\\frac{1}{2}$ time units and thus we have established an example in which the last ant falls off at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}+m-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$. So, we are left to prove that this is the latest possible moment.\n\nConsider any collision of two ants $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$. Let us change the rule for this collision, and enforce these two ants to turn anticlockwise. Then the succeeding behavior of all the ants does not change; the only difference is that $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$ swap their positions. These arguments may be applied to any collision separately, so we may assume that at any collision, either both ants rotate clockwise or both of them rotate anticlockwise by our own choice.\n\nFor instance, we may assume that there are only two types of ants, depending on their initial direction: NE-ants, which move only north or east, and $S W$-ants, moving only south and west. Then we immediately obtain that all ants will have fallen off the board after $2 m-1$ time units. However, we can get a better bound by considering the last moment at which a given ant collides with another ant.\n\nChoose a coordinate system such that the corners of the checkerboard are $(0,0),(m, 0),(m, m)$ and $(0, m)$. At time $t$, there will be no NE-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y<t+1\\}$ and no SW-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y>2 m-t-1\\}$.

Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case.

We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$.

Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$. Due to the symmetry between rows and columns, the same estimate holds with $b$ replaced by $c$. Averaging these two inequalities we arrive at our claim.\n\nNow let us multiply (2) by $H^{2}$, multiply (II) by $\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right)$ and add them; we get\n\n$H^{2}(2 m-1)+\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right) m \\leq a \\cdot \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{S^{2}}+(b+c) \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{2 S H}+d=a \\cdot \\frac{2 H}{S}+b+c+d$.\n\nThe left-hand side is exactly $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$, while the right-hand side does not exceed $a+b+c+d$ since $2 H \\leq S$.

We say that a set of $N$ flags is diverse if these flags can be arranged into an $N \times N$ square so that all $N$ fields on its main diagonal will have the same color.

Putting these $2 \\times 2$ squares on the diagonal of a $4 \\times 4$ square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on $N$; actually, above we have proved the base case $N=4$.

We also combine the letters; we call a block $a T L$-block if it is simultaneously T-block and L-block. Similarly we define TR-blocks, $B L$-blocks, and BR-blocks. The arrangement of blocks determines uniquely the arrangement of kings; so in the rest of the solution we consider the $50 \\times 50$ system of blocks (see Fig. 1). We identify the blocks by their coordinate pairs; the pair $(i, j)$, where $1 \\leq i, j \\leq 50$, refers to the $j$ th block in the $i$ th row (or the $i$ th block in the $j$ th column). The upper-left block is $(1,1)$.\n\nThe system of blocks has the following properties..\n\n$\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ If $(i, j)$ is a B-block then $(i+1, j)$ is a B-block: otherwise the kings in these two blocks can take each other. Similarly: if $(i, j)$ is a T-block then $(i-1, j)$ is a T-block; if $(i, j)$ is an L-block then $(i, j-1)$ is an L-block; if $(i, j)$ is an R-block then $(i, j+1)$ is an R-block.\n\n(ii') Each column contains exactly 25 L-blocks and 25 R-blocks, and each row contains exactly 25 T-blocks and 25 B-blocks. In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns. Similarly, there are exactly 25 L-rows and exactly 25 -rows.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary pair of a T-column and a neighboring B-column (columns with numbers $j$ and $j+1$ ).\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_e5e05688480445023103g-1.jpg?height=340&width=760&top_left_y=2126&top_left_x=451)\n\nFig. 1\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_e5e05688480445023103g-1.jpg?height=297&width=348&top_left_y=2167&top_left_x=1342)\n\nFig. 2\n\nCase 1. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns.

Suppose the 2006-gon has been dissected into triangles by 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. Find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.","['Call an isosceles triangle odd if it has two odd sides. Suppose we are given a dissection as in the problem statement. A triangle in the dissection which is odd and isosceles will be called iso-odd for brevity.\n\nLemma. Let $A B$ be one of dissecting diagonals and let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints $A, B$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{L}$ consists of $n$ segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes. This already gives us the required 1003 iso-odd triangles. Then we can complete the triangulation in an arbitrary fashion.', 'Let the terms odd triangle and iso-odd triangle have the same meaning as in the first solution.\n\nLet $A B C$ be an iso-odd triangle, with $A B$ and $B C$ odd sides. This means that there are an odd number of sides of the 2006-gon between $A$ and $B$ and also between $B$ and $C$. We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle. Let us assign these two sides (one in each group) to the triangle $A B C$.\n\nTo each iso-odd triangle we have thus assigned a pair of sides, with no two triangles sharing an assigned side.

That means $s_{2}-1=d_{1}=1$ and $s_{2}+1=d_{2} ;$ therefore $s_{2}=2$ and $d_{2}=3$.\n\nWe can repeat the above process in general.\n\nClaim. $d_{i}=2 i-1$ and $s_{i}=i$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$.\n\nProof. Apply induction on $i$. The Claim has been proved for $i=1,2$.

On the other hand, $d_{j}=s_{i+1}+i>2 i>d_{i}>d_{i-1}>\\ldots>d_{1}$, so $j \\leqslant i$ is not possible. The only possibility is $j=i+1$.\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\ns_{i+1}+i=d_{i+1}=s_{i+1}^{2}-s_{i}^{2}=s_{i+1}^{2}-i^{2} \\\\\ns_{i+1}^{2}-s_{i+1}=i(i+1) .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nBy solving this equation we get $s_{i+1}=i+1$ and $d_{i+1}=2 i+1$, that finishes the proof.\n\nNow we know that the positive divisors of the number $n$ are $1,3,5, \\ldots, n-2, n$. The greatest divisor is $d_{k}=2 k-1=n$ itself, so $n$ must be odd. The second greatest divisor is $d_{k-1}=n-2$; then $n-2$ divides $n=(n-2)+2$, so $n-2$ divides 2 . Therefore, $n$ must be 1 or 3 .\n\nThe numbers $n=1$ and $n=3$ obviously satisfy the requirements: for $n=1$ we have $k=1$ and $d_{1}=1^{2}$; for $n=3$ we have $k=2, d_{1}=1^{2}$ and $d_{1}+d_{2}=1+3=2^{2}$.']","['1,3']",True,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2021,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,74.4563949645012,

But the third line only contains integers, so $q$ must be an integer. Furthermore, the third line contains no number greater than $162=9^{2}+9^{2}-0^{2}-0^{2}$ or less than -162 , so we must have $-162 \\leqslant 81 q \\leqslant 162$.

216,1820,Combinatorics,"Let $n$ be a given positive integer. In the Cartesian plane, each lattice point with nonnegative coordinates initially contains a butterfly, and there are no other butterflies. The neighborhood of a lattice point $c$ consists of all lattice points within the axis-aligned $(2 n+1) \times$ $(2 n+1)$ square centered at $c$, apart from $c$ itself. We call a butterfly lonely, crowded, or comfortable, depending on whether the number of butterflies in its neighborhood $N$ is respectively less than, greater than, or equal to half of the number of lattice points in $N$.

Every minute, all lonely butterflies fly away simultaneously. This process goes on for as long as there are any lonely butterflies. Assuming that the process eventually stops, determine the number of comfortable butterflies at the final state.","['We always identify a butterfly with the lattice point it is situated at. For two points $p$ and $q$, we write $p \\geqslant q$ if each coordinate of $p$ is at least the corresponding coordinate of $q$. Let $O$ be the origin, and let $\\mathcal{Q}$ be the set of initially occupied points, i.e., of all lattice points with nonnegative coordinates. Let $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{H}}=\\{(x, 0): x \\geqslant 0\\}$ and $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{V}}=\\{(0, y): y \\geqslant 0\\}$ be the sets of the lattice points lying on the horizontal and vertical boundary rays of $\\mathcal{Q}$. Denote by $N(a)$ the neighborhood of a lattice point $a$.\n\n1. Initial observations. We call a set of lattice points up-right closed if its points stay in the set after being shifted by any lattice vector $(i, j)$ with $i, j \\geqslant 0$. Whenever the butterflies form a up-right closed set $\\mathcal{S}$, we have $|N(p) \\cap \\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant|N(q) \\cap \\mathcal{S}|$ for any two points $p, q \\in \\mathcal{S}$ with $p \\geqslant q$. So, since $\\mathcal{Q}$ is up-right closed, the set of butterflies at any moment also preserves this property. We assume all forthcoming sets of lattice points to be up-right closed.\n\nWhen speaking of some set $\\mathcal{S}$ of lattice points, we call its points lonely, comfortable, or crowded with respect to this set (i.e., as if the butterflies were exactly at all points of $\\mathcal{S}$ ). We call a set $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ stable if it contains no lonely points. In what follows, we are interested only in those stable sets whose complements in $\\mathcal{Q}$ are finite, because one can easily see that only a finite number of butterflies can fly away on each minute.\n\nIf the initial set $\\mathcal{Q}$ of butterflies contains some stable set $\\mathcal{S}$, then, clearly no butterfly of this set will fly away. On the other hand, the set $\\mathcal{F}$ of all butterflies in the end of the process is stable. This means that $\\mathcal{F}$ is the largest (with respect to inclusion) stable set within $\\mathcal{Q}$, and we are about to describe this set.\n\n2. A description of a final set. The following notion will be useful.

Consider all the rays emerging at $O$ and passing through a point from $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$; number them as $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}$ in increasing order according to slope.

We will concentrate on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve $d_{0} d_{1} \\ldots d_{m}$; let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all lattice points $p$ such that $p \\geqslant p^{\\prime}$ for some (not necessarily lattice) point $p^{\\prime}$ on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve. In fact, we will show that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nClearly, the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is symmetric in the line $y=x$. Denote by $D$ the convex hull of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n3. We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points. The boundary of $S$ consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve for some set of lattice vectors $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\nClaim 1. For every $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$, there is a $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$ co-directed with $\\vec{v}$ with $\\left|\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}\\right| \\geqslant|\\vec{v}|$.\n\nProof. Let $\\ell$ be the supporting line of $S$ parallel to $\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e., $\\ell$ contains some point of $S$, and the set $S$ lies on one side of $\\ell$ ). Take any point $b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}$ and consider $N(b)$. The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_7a19e2bb8c2d14faaec3g-1.jpg?height=348&width=888&top_left_y=1388&top_left_x=230)\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_7a19e2bb8c2d14faaec3g-1.jpg?height=529&width=634&top_left_y=1209&top_left_x=1196)\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_f1c49764120e157dab39g-1.jpg?height=402&width=1044&top_left_y=598&top_left_x=504)\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_f1c49764120e157dab39g-1.jpg?height=528&width=1108&top_left_y=1558&top_left_x=471)\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$.

224,1828,Geometry,"There are 2017 mutually external circles drawn on a blackboard, such that no two are tangent and no three share a common tangent. A tangent segment is a line segment that is a common tangent to two circles, starting at one tangent point and ending at the other one. Luciano is drawing tangent segments on the blackboard, one at a time, so that no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments. Luciano keeps drawing tangent segments until no more can be drawn. Find all possible numbers of tangent segments when he stops drawing.","['First, consider a particular arrangement of circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ where all the centers are aligned and each $C_{i}$ is eclipsed from the other circles by its neighbors - for example, taking $C_{i}$ with center $\\left(i^{2}, 0\\right)$ and radius $i / 2$ works. Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_ddf01533612b4e304e04g-1.jpg?height=249&width=1328&top_left_y=1069&top_left_x=358)\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_7616c5df3d9f3b009edcg-1.jpg?height=305&width=1424&top_left_y=293&top_left_x=316)\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_7616c5df3d9f3b009edcg-1.jpg?height=316&width=1354&top_left_y=1232&top_left_x=356)\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_7616c5df3d9f3b009edcg-1.jpg?height=560&width=1011&top_left_y=2210&top_left_x=525)\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_7b449d48a50a94717be6g-1.jpg?height=554&width=1014&top_left_y=588&top_left_x=521)\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_7b449d48a50a94717be6g-1.jpg?height=531&width=1014&top_left_y=1388&top_left_x=521)\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.', ""First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_c9bbca47e7522d694d86g-1.jpg?height=626&width=580&top_left_y=178&top_left_x=744)\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_c9bbca47e7522d694d86g-1.jpg?height=623&width=574&top_left_y=2144&top_left_x=747)\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_68dd7b660ac2c320e605g-1.jpg?height=529&width=803&top_left_y=1009&top_left_x=638)\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$.""]",['6048'],False,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2017,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,155.47123722743174,

Assume that only $k<2 n$ cells are marked, and there exists a partition $P$ satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from $P$. Let $d$ be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of $P$. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in $d$ are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell $c$ lying on the diagonal $d$. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to $d$. Thus they connect $c$ to different cells. This shows $c$ belongs to a cycle $C(c)$ of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{m}$ where $c_{0}=c$ and $m$ is the least positive integer such that $c_{m}$ lies on $d$. Clearly, $c_{m}$ is distinct from $c$. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to $d$ also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form $C(c)$. Hence, $C(c)$ contains exactly two cells from $d$. Then all $2 n$ cells in $d$ belong to $n$ cycles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$, each has length at least 4.\n\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a cycle $C_{i}$ containing at most one of the $k$ marked cells.

We prove that, in fact, if a board initially contains an even number $n>1$ of ones, then $A$ can guarantee to obtain $S_{2}(n)$, but not more, cookies. The binary representation of 2020 is $2020=\\overline{11111100100}_{2}$, so $S_{2}(2020)=7$, and the answer follows.\n\nA strategy for A. At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 . Thus at the end of each round the board contains at least $S_{2}(n)$ numbers, while $A$ follows the above strategy. So $A$ can guarantee at least $S_{2}(n)$ cookies for himself.\n\nA strategy for $B$.

We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof.

We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good. By Lemma 3, when the game terminates, the board contains at most $s$ numbers.

He repeatedly does the following operation: if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$, then he flips the $k^{\text {th }}$ coin over; otherwise he stops the process. (For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\rightarrow H H T \rightarrow H T T \rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)

Letting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.","[""We represent the problem using a directed graph $G_{n}$ whose vertices are the length- $n$ strings of $H$ 's and $T$ 's. The graph features an edge from each string to its successor (except for $T T \\cdots T T$, which has no successor). We will also write $\\bar{H}=T$ and $\\bar{T}=H$.\n\nThe graph $G_{0}$ consists of a single vertex: the empty string. The main claim is that $G_{n}$ can be described explicitly in terms of $G_{n-1}$ :\n\n- We take two copies, $X$ and $Y$, of $G_{n-1}$.\n- In $X$, we take each string of $n-1$ coins and just append a $T$ to it. In symbols, we replace $s_{1} \\cdots s_{n-1}$ with $s_{1} \\cdots s_{n-1} T$.\n- In $Y$, we take each string of $n-1$ coins, flip every coin, reverse the order, and append an $H$ to it. In symbols, we replace $s_{1} \\cdots s_{n-1}$ with $\\bar{s}_{n-1} \\bar{s}_{n-2} \\cdots \\bar{s}_{1} H$.\n- Finally, we add one new edge from $Y$ to $X$, namely $H H \\cdots H H H \\rightarrow H H \\cdots H H T$.\n\nWe depict $G_{4}$ below, in a way which indicates this recursive construction:\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_f299f1594c6d1eae91bdg-1.jpg?height=505&width=1125&top_left_y=1855&top_left_x=477)\n\nWe prove the claim inductively. Firstly, $X$ is correct as a subgraph of $G_{n}$, as the operation on coins is unchanged by an extra $T$ at the end: if $s_{1} \\cdots s_{n-1}$ is sent to $t_{1} \\cdots t_{n-1}$, then $s_{1} \\cdots s_{n-1} T$ is sent to $t_{1} \\cdots t_{n-1} T$.\n\nNext, $Y$ is also correct as a subgraph of $G_{n}$, as if $s_{1} \\cdots s_{n-1}$ has $k$ occurrences of $H$, then $\\bar{s}_{n-1} \\cdots \\bar{s}_{1} H$ has $(n-1-k)+1=n-k$ occurrences of $H$, and thus (provided that $k>0$ ), if $s_{1} \\cdots s_{n-1}$ is sent to $t_{1} \\cdots t_{n-1}$, then $\\bar{s}_{n-1} \\cdots \\bar{s}_{1} H$ is sent to $\\bar{t}_{n-1} \\cdots \\bar{t}_{1} H$.\n\nFinally, the one edge from $Y$ to $X$ is correct, as the operation does send $H H \\cdots H H H$ to HH $\\cdots H H T$.\n\n\n\nTo finish, note that the sequences in $X$ take an average of $E(n-1)$ steps to terminate, whereas the sequences in $Y$ take an average of $E(n-1)$ steps to reach $H H \\cdots H$ and then an additional $n$ steps to terminate. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\nE(n)=\\frac{1}{2}(E(n-1)+(E(n-1)+n))=E(n-1)+\\frac{n}{2}\n$$\n\nWe have $E(0)=0$ from our description of $G_{0}$.

The machine is initially positioned at the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin, where there are $k$ heads (and the position before the first coin is considered to be the $0^{\\text {th }}$ coin). The machine then moves according to the following rules, stopping when it reaches the position before the first coin: if the coin at its current position is $H$, it flips the coin and moves to the previous coin, while if the coin at its current position is $T$, it flips the coin and moves to the next position.\n\nConsider the maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction. Suppose the machine has $a$ consecutive moves to the next coin, before a move to the previous coin. After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin. Similarly, $a$ consecutive moves to the previous coin are followed by at least $a+1$ consecutive moves to\n\n\n\nthe next coin. There cannot be more than $n$ consecutive moves in the same direction, so this proves that the process terminates (with a move from the first coin to the position before the first coin).\n\nThus we have a (possibly empty) sequence $a_{1}<\\cdots<a_{t} \\leqslant n$ giving the lengths of maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction, where the final $a_{t}$ moves must be moves to the previous coin, ending before the first coin.

This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)', 'We explicitly describe what happens with an arbitrary sequence $C$ of $n$ coins.

No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.

At the intersection of two walls there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.

After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.

Let $k(\mathfrak{L})$ be the largest number $k$ such that, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth $\mathfrak{L}$, Morgana can always place at least $k$ knights such that no two of them can ever meet. For each $n$, what are all possible values for $k(\mathfrak{L})$, where $\mathfrak{L}$ is a labyrinth with $n$ walls?","['First we show by induction that the $n$ walls divide the plane into $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions. The claim is true for $n=0$ as, when there are no walls, the plane forms a single region. When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$. Consider adding the edges of $G$ sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one. Therefore the number of connected components of $\\mathrm{G}$ is at least $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1-\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=n+1$. If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.', 'We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design.

We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_3da5efb4f498a8fdcd67g-1.jpg?height=502&width=520&top_left_y=1899&top_left_x=768)\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_118db4b8429146d8d5a9g-1.jpg?height=482&width=1468&top_left_y=362&top_left_x=294)\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur\'s actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights.']",['$k=n+1$'],False,,Expression,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2019,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,115.7705484762073,

Suppose that in the first round Bob made a $k$-move and Alice picked the left group, and then in the second round Bob makes an $\\ell$-move, with $\\ell>k$. We may then assume, without loss of generality, that Alice again picks the left group.\n\nProof. Suppose Alice picks the right group in the second round. Then the combined effect of the two rounds is that each of the boxes $B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{\\ell}$ lost two pebbles (and the other boxes are unchanged). Hence this configuration is strictly dominated by that before the first round, and it suffices to consider only Alice's other response.\n\nFor Alice. Alice initially distributes pebbles according to $V_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil}$. Suppose the current configuration of pebbles dominates $V_{i}$. If Bob makes a $k$-move with $k \\geqslant i$ then Alice picks the left group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i+1}$. Likewise, if Bob makes a $k$-move with $k<i$ then Alice picks the right group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i-1}$. Since none of $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{N}$ contains an empty box, Alice can prevent Bob from ever winning.\n\nFor Bob. The key idea in this solution is the following claim.\n\nClaim. If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move. By Observation A, we may suppose Alice always picks the left group. After Bob's $(2 k-1)$-move, the rightmost box becomes empty and Bob wins.\n\nNow, we claim that if $n<M$ then either there already exists an empty box, or there exist a positive integer $k$ and $2 k$ boxes with at most $k$ pebbles each (and thus Bob can force a win). Otherwise, assume each box contains at least 1 pebble, and for each $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, at least $N-(2 k-1)=N+1-2 k$ boxes contain at least $k+1$ pebbles. Summing, there are at least as many pebbles in total as in $V_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil}$; that is, at least $M$ pebbles, as desired."", ""We present solutions for the general case of $N>1$ boxes, and write $M=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$ for the claimed answer. For $1 \\leqslant k<N$, say that Bob makes a $k$-move if he splits the boxes into a left group $\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{k}\\right\\}$ and a right group $\\left\\{B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{N}\\right\\}$. Say that one configuration dominates another if it has at least as many pebbles in each box, and say that it strictly dominates the other configuration if it also has more pebbles in at least one box. (Thus, if Bob wins in some configuration, he also wins in every configuration that it dominates.)\n\nIt is often convenient to consider ' $V$-shaped' configurations; for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant N$, let $V_{i}$ be the configuration where $B_{j}$ contains $1+|j-i|$ pebbles (i.e. where the $i^{\\text {th }}$ box has a single pebble and the numbers increase by one in both directions, so the first box has $i$ pebbles and the last box has $N+1-i$ pebbles). Note that $V_{i}$ contains $\\frac{1}{2} i(i+1)+\\frac{1}{2}(N+1-i)(N+2-i)-1$ pebbles. If $i=\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$, this number equals $M$.solution split naturally into a strategy for Alice (starting with $M$ pebbles and showing she can prevent Bob from winning) and a strategy for Bob (showing he can win for any starting configuration with at most $M-1$ pebbles). The following observation is also useful to simplify the analysis of strategies for Bob.\n\nObservation A. Consider two consecutive rounds. Suppose that in the first round Bob made a $k$-move and Alice picked the left group, and then in the second round Bob makes an $\\ell$-move, with $\\ell>k$. We may then assume, without loss of generality, that Alice again picks the left group.\n\nProof. Suppose Alice picks the right group in the second round. Then the combined effect of the two rounds is that each of the boxes $B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{\\ell}$ lost two pebbles (and the other boxes are unchanged). Hence this configuration is strictly dominated by that before the first round, and it suffices to consider only Alice's other response.\n\n\nFor Alice. Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. Alice starts with the boxes in the configuration $V_{K}$. For each of Bob's $N-1$ possible choices, consider the subset of rounds in which he makes that choice. In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times. This means that the number of pebbles in a box could decrease by at most the number of choices for which Alice would have started by removing a pebble from the group containing that box. These numbers are, for each box,\n\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor,\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right\\rfloor, \\ldots, 1,0,1, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nThese are pointwise less than the numbers of pebbles the boxes started with, meaning that no box ever becomes empty with this strategy.\n\nSo the final answer is $n=960$. In general, if there are $N>1$ boxes, the answer is $n=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$.\n\nCommon remarks. We present solutions for the general case of $N>1$ boxes, and write $M=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$ for the claimed answer. For $1 \\leqslant k<N$, say that Bob makes a $k$-move if he splits the boxes into a left group $\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{k}\\right\\}$ and a right group $\\left\\{B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{N}\\right\\}$. Say that one configuration dominates another if it has at least as many pebbles in each box, and say that it strictly dominates the other configuration if it also has more pebbles in at least one box. (Thus, if Bob wins in some configuration, he also wins in every configuration that it dominates.)\n\nIt is often convenient to consider ' $V$-shaped' configurations; for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant N$, let $V_{i}$ be the configuration where $B_{j}$ contains $1+|j-i|$ pebbles (i.e. where the $i^{\\text {th }}$ box has a single pebble and the numbers increase by one in both directions, so the first box has $i$ pebbles and the last box has $N+1-i$ pebbles). Note that $V_{i}$ contains $\\frac{1}{2} i(i+1)+\\frac{1}{2}(N+1-i)(N+2-i)-1$ pebbles. If $i=\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$, this number equals $M$.\n\nFor Bob. Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side. That is, the numbers of pebbles in $X$ are at least\n\n$$\n\\frac{N}{2}, \\frac{N}{2}-1, \\ldots, 1,1, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}\n\\tag{C}\n$$\n\nwith equality occurring at least once on each side. Bob does an $\\frac{N}{2}$-move. Whichever group Alice chooses, the total number of pebbles is unchanged, and the side from which pebbles are removed now has a box with fewer pebbles than in $(C)$, so the previous case of Bob's strategy can now be applied.""]",['960'],False,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2019,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,147.09934905600986,

Substituting this into (2) we obtain that\n\n$$\nA x+(A+B)=A^{2} x+(A B+B)\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$; applying this to $x=0$ and $x=1$ we infer $A+B=A B+B$ and $A^{2}=A$. The second equation leads to $A=0$ or $A=1$. In case $A=1$, the first equation gives $B=1$, meaning that $f$ has to be the successor function. If $A=0$, then $f$ is constant and (1) shows that its constant value has to be -1 . Thereby the solution is complete.', 'We commence by deriving (2) and (3) as in the first solution. Now provided that $f$ is injective, (2) tells us that $f$ is the successor function. Thus we may assume from now on that $f$ is not injective, i.e., that there are two integers $a>b$ with $f(a)=f(b)$. A straightforward induction using (2) in the induction step reveals that we have $f(a+n)=f(b+n)$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. Consequently, the sequence $\\gamma_{n}=f(b+n)$ is periodic and thus in particular bounded, which means that the numbers\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\min _{n \\geqslant 0} \\gamma_{n} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\psi=\\max _{n \\geqslant 0} \\gamma_{n}\n$$\n\nexist.\n\nLet us pick any integer $y$ with $f(y)=\\varphi$ and then an integer $x \\geqslant a$ with $f(x-f(y))=\\varphi$.

Since $\\varphi \\leqslant \\psi$ holds trivially, it follows that $\\varphi=\\psi=-1$, or in other words that we have $f(t)=-1$ for all integers $t \\geqslant a$.\n\nFinally, if any integer $y$ is given, we may find an integer $x$ which is so large that $x+1 \\geqslant a$ and $x-f(y) \\geqslant a$ hold. Due to (3) and the result from the previous paragraph we get\n\n$$\nf(y)=f(x+1)-f(x-f(y))-1=(-1)-(-1)-1=-1 .\n$$\n\nThereby the problem is solved.', 'Set $d=f(0)$.

In plain English, this means that on any residue class modulo $k$ the function $f$ is linear with slope 1 .\n\nNow by (7) the set of all values attained by $f$ is such a residue class. Hence, there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that $f(f(x))=f(x)+c$ holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.

So by (7) again, $f$ attains the value -1 .\n\nThus we may apply (9) to some integer $y$ with $f(y)=-1$, which gives $f(x+1)=f(x)+c$. So $f$ is a linear function with slope $c$. Hence, (8) leads to $c=1$, wherefore there is an absolute constant $d^{\\prime}$ with $f(x)=x+d^{\\prime}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Using this for $x=0$ we obtain $d^{\\prime}=d$ and finally (4) discloses $d=1$, meaning that $f$ is indeed the successor function.']","['$f(x)=-1$,$f(x)=x+1$']",True,,Expression,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2015,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,103.66080187455901,

So $a_{k}$ is partitioning exactly when $\\ell_{k}=g_{k}$.\n\nWe proceed by proving some properties of partitioning elements, using the following claim. Claim. If $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k}$ are partitioning where $2 \\leqslant k \\leqslant n-1$, then $g_{k-1}=g_{k}=a_{k}$.\n\nProof. Assume that $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k}$ are partitioning. Since $\\ell_{k-1}=g_{k-1}$, we have $\\ell_{k-1} \\mid a_{k}$. Therefore, $g_{k}=\\ell_{k}=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(\\ell_{k-1}, a_{k}\\right)=a_{k}$, and $g_{k-1}=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{k}, g_{k}\\right)=a_{k}$, as desired.\n\nProperty 1. For every $k=2,3, \\ldots, n-2$, at least one of $a_{k-1}, a_{k}$, and $a_{k+1}$ is not partitioning. Proof. Suppose, to the contrary, that all three numbers $a_{k-1}, a_{k}$, and $a_{k+1}$ are partitioning. The claim yields that $a_{k+1}=g_{k}=a_{k}$, a contradiction.\n\nProperty 2. The elements $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ cannot be simultaneously partitioning. Also, $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ cannot be simultaneously partitioning\n\nProof. Assume that $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are partitioning. By the claim, it follows that $a_{2}=g_{1}=\\ell_{1}=$ $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(a_{1}\\right)=a_{1}$, a contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, assume that $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are partitioning. The claim yields that $a_{n-1}=g_{n-1}=$ $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}\\right)=a_{n}$, a contradiction.\n\nNow let $A$ be an $n$-element set with exactly 2015 good partitions. Clearly, we have $n \\geqslant 5$. Using Property 2, we find that there is at most one partitioning element in each of $\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$. By Property 1 , there are at least $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n-5}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ non-partitioning elements in $\\left\\{a_{3}, a_{4}, \\ldots, a_{n-3}\\right\\}$. Therefore, there are at most $(n-1)-2-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n-5}{3}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lceil\\frac{2(n-2)}{3}\\right\\rceil$ partitioning elements in $A$. Thus, $\\left\\lceil\\frac{2(n-2)}{3}\\right\\rceil \\geqslant 2015$, which implies that $n \\geqslant 3024$.\n\nFinally, we show that there exists a set of 3024 positive integers with exactly 2015 partitioning elements. Indeed, in the set $A=\\left\\{2 \\cdot 6^{i}, 3 \\cdot 6^{i}, 6^{i+1} \\mid 0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 1007\\right\\}$, each element of the form $3 \\cdot 6^{i}$ or $6^{i}$, except $6^{1008}$, is partitioning.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of $n$ is 3024 .']",['3024'],False,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2015,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,86.49174160819243,

357,1962,Number Theory,"Determine all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers for which $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are powers of 2 .

Explanation: A power of 2 is an integer of the form $2^{n}$, where $n$ denotes some nonnegative integer.","['It can easily be verified that these sixteen triples are as required. Now let $(a, b, c)$ be any triple with the desired property. If we would have $a=1$, then both $b-c$ and $c-b$ were powers of 2 , which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 1. Among $a, b$, and $c$ there are at least two equal numbers.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that $a=b$. Then $a^{2}-c$ and $a(c-1)$ are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually $a$ and $c-1$ are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ with $a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $c=2^{\\gamma}+1$. Since $a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have $\\gamma \\leqslant 1$. Moreover, each of the terms $2^{2 \\alpha}-2$ and $2^{2 \\alpha}-3$ can only be a power of 2 if $\\alpha=1$. It follows that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,2)$ or $(2,2,3)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct.\n\nDue to symmetry we may suppose that\n\n$$\n2 \\leqslant a<b<c .\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nWe are to prove that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,6,11)$ or $(3,5,7)$. By our hypothesis, there exist three nonnegative integers $\\alpha, \\beta$, and $\\gamma$ such that\n\n$$\nb c-a  =2^{\\alpha}, \\tag{2}\n$$\n$$\na c-b  =2^{\\beta}, \\tag{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad a b-c =2^{\\gamma} .\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nEvidently we have\n\n$$\n\\alpha>\\beta>\\gamma\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nDepending on how large $a$ is, we divide the argument into two further cases.\n\nCase 2.1. $\\quad a=2$.\n\nWe first prove that $\\gamma=0$. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\gamma>0$. Then $c$ is even by (4) and, similarly, $b$ is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if $b c=4$. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that $\\gamma=0$, i.e., that $c=2 b-1$.\n\nNow (3) yields $3 b-2=2^{\\beta}$. Due to $b>2$ this is only possible if $\\beta \\geqslant 4$. If $\\beta=4$, then we get $b=6$ and $c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11$, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case $\\beta \\geqslant 5$. Now (2) implies\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n$$\n\nand by $\\beta \\geqslant 5$ the right-hand side is not divisible by 32 . Thus $\\alpha \\leqslant 4$ and we get a contradiction to (5).\n\n\n\nCase 2.2. $a \\geqslant 3$.\n\nPick an integer $\\vartheta \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ such that $c-\\vartheta$ is not divisible by 4 . Now\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}+\\vartheta \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=\\left(b c-a \\vartheta^{2}\\right)+\\vartheta(c a-b)=(b+a \\vartheta)(c-\\vartheta)\n$$\n\nis divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and, consequently, $b+a \\vartheta$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta-1}$. On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.', 'As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution. There are sixteen such triples, namely $(2,2,2)$, the three permutations of $(2,2,3)$, and the six permutations of each of $(2,6,11)$ and $(3,5,7)$\n']","['$(2,2,2),(2,2,3),(2,3,2),(3,2,2),(2,6,11),(2,11,6),(6,2,11),(6,11,2),(11,2,6),(11,6,2),(3,5,7),(3,7,5),(5,3,7),(5,7,3),(7,3,5),(7,5,3)$']",True,,Tuple,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2015,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,122.20060515909587,

Now, if there are two distinct even numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both even, then $2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)$, a contradiction.

Now we suppose that there is an odd prime $p$ for which $p \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)$ and derive a contradiction.\n\nWe first claim that $2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant B$. This is a rather weak bound; one way to prove it is as follows. Observe that $g(k+1)>g(k)$ and hence $2^{g(k+1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(k)+1}+1$ for every positive integer $k$. By repeatedly applying this inequality, we obtain $2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(n)+1}+(m-1)-n=B$.\n\nNow, since $p \\mid B$, we have $p-1<B \\leqslant 2^{g(m-1)+1}$, so that $p-1 \\mid\\left(2^{g(m-1)+1}\\right) !=g(m)$.

$$","['A straightforward check shows that all the functions listed in the answer satisfy the problem condition. It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that $f$ is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$ also satisfies this condition. Replacing $f$ by $g$, we assume from now on that $f(0)=0$; then $f(n)>0$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer $a$ with $\\mho(a)=0$ such that $f(n)=a n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set $N=10^{100}$. We say that a prime $p$ is large if $p>N$, and $p$ is small otherwise; let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer $k$, we denote the greatest large divisor of $k$ and the greatest small divisor of $k$ by $L(k)$ and $S(k)$, respectively; thus, $k=L(k) S(k)$.\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\n\nStep 1. We prove that for every large $k$, we have $k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b$. In other $\\overline{\\text { words, }} L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nWe use induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, assume that $k_{0}$ is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers $k$ with $k<k_{0}$.\n\nClaim 1. For any integers $x$ and $y$ with $0<x-y<k_{0}$, the number $k_{0}$ does not divide $f(x)-f(y)$.\n\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that $k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Let $\\ell=L(x-y)$; then $\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}$. By the induction hypothesis, $\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)$, and thus $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Notice that $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ is large, and $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell$.

By Claim 1, for every integer $a$ each of the sequences\n\n$$\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo $k_{0}$. This yields $f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. Thus, $f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ whenever $a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, if $a \\not \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ then there exists an integer $b^{\\prime}$ such that $b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}$. Then $f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. The induction step is proved.\n\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $\\overline{f(n)}=$ an. In other words, $f$ is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement.\n\n\n\nClaim 2. There exists a constant $c$ such that $f(t)<c t$ for every positive integer $t>N$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ be the product of all small primes, and let $\\alpha$ be a positive integer such that $2^{\\alpha}>f(N)$. Then, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the numbers $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)$ are distinct modulo $p^{\\alpha}$. Set $P=d^{\\alpha}$ and $c=P+f(N)$.\n\nChoose any integer $t>N$. Due to the choice of $\\alpha$, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists at most one nonnegative integer $i \\leqslant N$ with $p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)$. Since $|\\mathcal{S}|<N$, we can choose a nonnegative integer $j \\leqslant N$ such that $p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, $S(f(t)-f(j))<P$.\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that $L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j$. Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $f(t)=a t$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$. Applying Claim 3, we successively obtain that $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{i+1}, R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_{i+N !}=R_{i}$.

As these two conditions cannot be met at the same time, we have indeed $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$.\n\nTo show that $P(0)=1$ is possible as well, we verify that the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ satisfies (1).

Now we show that no values other than those mentioned in the answer are possible for $P(0)$. To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$.

Thus one of these squares is empty.\n\n(ii). Now we assume that $n \\leqslant \\ell^{2}$. Firstly, we will construct a happy configuration with no empty $\\ell \\times \\ell$ square for the case $n=\\ell^{2}$. After that we will modify it to work for smaller values of $n$.\n\nLet us enumerate the rows from bottom to top as well as the columns from left to right by the numbers $0,1, \\ldots, \\ell^{2}-1$. Every square will be denoted, as usual, by the pair $(r, c)$ of its row and column numbers. Now we put the rooks on all squares of the form $(i \\ell+j, j \\ell+i)$ with $i, j=0,1, \\ldots, \\ell-1$ (the picture below represents this arrangement for $\\ell=3$ ). Since each number from 0 to $\\ell^{2}-1$ has a unique representation of the form $i \\ell+j(0 \\leqslant i, j \\leqslant \\ell-1)$, each row and each column contains exactly one rook.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_6bffd76c0a531bad8648g-1.jpg?height=525&width=531&top_left_y=1548&top_left_x=768)\n\nNext, we show that each $\\ell \\times \\ell$ square $A$ on the board contains a rook. Consider such a square $A$, and consider $\\ell$ consecutive rows the union of which contains $A$. Let the lowest of these rows have number $p \\ell+q$ with $0 \\leqslant p, q \\leqslant \\ell-1$ (notice that $p \\ell+q \\leqslant \\ell^{2}-\\ell$ ). Then the rooks in this union are placed in the columns with numbers $q \\ell+p,(q+1) \\ell+p, \\ldots,(\\ell-1) \\ell+p$, $p+1, \\ell+(p+1), \\ldots,(q-1) \\ell+p+1$, or, putting these numbers in increasing order,\n\n$$\np+1, \\ell+(p+1), \\ldots,(q-1) \\ell+(p+1), q \\ell+p,(q+1) \\ell+p, \\ldots,(\\ell-1) \\ell+p\n$$\n\nOne readily checks that the first number in this list is at most $\\ell-1$ (if $p=\\ell-1$, then $q=0$, and the first listed number is $q \\ell+p=\\ell-1)$, the last one is at least $(\\ell-1) \\ell$, and the difference between any two consecutive numbers is at most $\\ell$. Thus, one of the $\\ell$ consecutive columns intersecting $A$ contains a number listed above, and the rook in this column is inside $A$, as required. The construction for $n=\\ell^{2}$ is established.\n\n\n\nIt remains to construct a happy configuration of rooks not containing an empty $\\ell \\times \\ell$ square for $n<\\ell^{2}$. In order to achieve this, take the construction for an $\\ell^{2} \\times \\ell^{2}$ square described above and remove the $\\ell^{2}-n$ bottom rows together with the $\\ell^{2}-n$ rightmost columns. We will have a rook arrangement with no empty $\\ell \\times \\ell$ square, but several rows and columns may happen to be empty. Clearly, the number of empty rows is equal to the number of empty columns, so one can find a bijection between them, and put a rook on any crossing of an empty row and an empty column corresponding to each other.']",['$\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-1}\\rfloor$'],False,,Expression,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2014,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,87.83957528036572,
372,1977,Combinatorics,"We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a real number on it. For every real number $x$, there is exactly one card in the deck that has $x$ written on it. Now two players draw disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ of 100 cards each from this deck. We would like to define a rule that declares one of them a winner. This rule should satisfy the following conditions:

1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards: if the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are told which card belongs to which player, but not what numbers are written on them, we can still decide the winner.
2. If we write the elements of both sets in increasing order as $A=\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{100}\right\}$ and $B=\left\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{100}\right\}$, and $a_{i}>b_{i}$ for all $i$, then $A$ beats $B$.
3. If three players draw three disjoint sets $A, B, C$ from the deck, $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $A$ also beats $C$.

How many ways are there to define such a rule?

We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$.

Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint.

This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$.

It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$.

If all the $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}$ 's are distinct, then $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} 2^{\\ell_{i}} \\leqslant \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2^{j}=2^{n}-1$, so one has $s=d$ and $t=\\sum_{i=1}^{d} 2^{\\ell_{i}}$, whence $s=d=\\sigma_{2}(t)$; this is impossible.

We say that a pair of positive real numbers $(x, y)$ is $\\operatorname{good}$ if $x f(y)+y f(x) \\leqslant 2$. Observe that if $(x, y)$ is good, then so is $(y, x)$.\n\nLemma 1.0. If $(x, y)$ is good, then $x=y$.\n\nProof. Assume that there exist positive real numbers $x \\neq y$ such that $(x, y)$ is good. The uniqueness assumption says that $y$ is the unique positive real number such that $(x, y)$ is good. In particular, $(x, x)$ is not a good pair. This means that\n\n$$\nx f(x)+x f(x)>2\n$$\n\nand thus $x f(x)>1$. Similarly, $(y, x)$ is a good pair, so $(y, y)$ is not a good pair, which implies $y f(y)>1$. We apply the AM-GM inequality to obtain\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x) \\geqslant 2 \\sqrt{x f(y) \\cdot y f(x)}=2 \\sqrt{x f(x) \\cdot y f(y)}>2\n$$\n\nThis is a contradiction, since $(x, y)$ is a good pair.\n\nBy assumption, for any $x>0$, there always exists a good pair containing $x$, however Lemma 1 implies that the only good pair that can contain $x$ is $(x, x)$, so\n\n$$\nx f(x) \\leqslant 1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad f(x) \\leqslant \\frac{1}{x},\n$$\n\nfor every $x>0$.\n\nIn particular, with $x=1 / f(t)$ for $t>0$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f(t)} \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right) \\leqslant 1\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nt \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right) \\leqslant t f(t) \\leqslant 1\n$$\n\nWe claim that $(t, 1 / f(t))$ is a good pair for every $t>0$.

We give an alternative way to prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ assuming $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$ for every $x>0$.\n\nIndeed, if $f(x)<1 / x$ then for every $a>0$ with $f(x)<1 / a<1 / x$ (and there are at least two of them), we have\n\n$$\na f(x)+x f(a)<1+\\frac{x}{a}<2 .\n$$\n\nHence $(x, a)$ is a good pair for every such $a$, a contradiction. We conclude that $f(x)=1 / x$.\n\n\n2. We can also conclude from Lemma 1 and $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$ as follows.\n\nLemma 2. The function $f$ is decreasing.\n\nProof. Let $y>x>0$. Lemma 1 says that $(x, y)$ is not a good pair, but $(y, y)$ is. Hence\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x)>2 \\geqslant 2 y f(y)>y f(y)+x f(y),\n$$\n\nwhere we used $y>x$ (and $f(y)>0$ ) in the last inequality. This implies that $f(x)>f(y)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ for all $x$. Fix a value of $x$ and note that for $y>x$ we must have $x f(x)+y f(x)>x f(y)+y f(x)>2$ (using that $f$ is decreasing for the first step), hence $f(x)>\\frac{2}{x+y}$. The last inequality is true for every $y>x>0$. If we fix $x$ and look for the supremum of the expression $\\frac{2}{x+y}$ over all $y>x$, we get\n\n$$\nf(x) \\geqslant \\frac{2}{x+x}=\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\n\nSince we already know that $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$, we conclude that $f(x)=1 / x$.', 'As in the first solution, we note that $f(x)=1 / x$ is a solution, and we set out to prove that it is the only one. We write $g(x)$ for the unique positive real number such that $(x, g(x))$ is a good pair. In this solution, we prove Lemma 2 without assuming Lemma 1.\n\nLemma 2. The function $f$ is decreasing.\n\nProof. Consider $x<y$. It holds that $y f(g(y))+g(y) f(y) \\leqslant 2$. Moreover, because $y$ is the only positive real number such that $(g(y), y)$ is a good pair and $x \\neq y$, we have $x f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>$ 2. Combining these two inequalities yields\n\n$$\nx f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>2 \\geqslant y f(g(y))+g(y) f(y)\n$$\n\nor $f(g(y))(x-y)>g(y)(f(y)-f(x))$. Because $g(y)$ and $f(g(y))$ are both positive while $x-y$ is negative, it follows that $f(y)<f(x)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 1 using Lemma 2. Suppose that $x \\neq y$ but $x f(y)+y f(x) \\leqslant 2$. As in the first solution, we get $x f(x)+x f(x)>2$ and $y f(y)+y f(y)>2$, which implies $x f(x)+y f(y)>2$. Now\n\n$$\nx f(x)+y f(y)>2 \\geqslant x f(y)+y f(x)\n$$\n\nimplies $(x-y)(f(x)-f(y))>0$, which contradicts the fact that $f$ is decreasing. So $y=x$ is the unique $y$ such that $(x, y)$ is a good pair, and in particular we have $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$.\n\nWe can now conclude the proof', 'As in the other solutions we verify that the function $f(x)=1 / x$ is a solution. We first want to prove the following lemma:\n\nLemma 3. For all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ we actually have $x f(g(x))+g(x) f(x)=2$ (that is: the inequality is actually an equality).\n\n\n\nProof. We proceed by contradiction: Assume there exists some number $x>0$ such that for $y=g(x)$ we have $x f(y)+y f(x)<2$. Then for any $0<\\epsilon<\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 f(x)}$ we have, by uniqueness of $y$, that $x f(y+\\epsilon)+(y+\\epsilon) f(x)>2$. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(y+\\epsilon) & >\\frac{2-(y+\\epsilon) f(x)}{x}=\\frac{2-y f(x)-\\epsilon f(x)}{x} \\\\\n& >\\frac{2-y f(x)-\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2}}{x} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}+f(y)>f(y) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, for every such $\\epsilon$ we have $g(y+\\epsilon) f(y+\\epsilon)+(y+\\epsilon) f(g(y+\\epsilon)) \\leqslant 2$ and $g(y+\\epsilon) f(y)+y f(g(y+\\epsilon))>2($ since $y \\neq y+\\epsilon=g(g(y+\\epsilon)))$. This gives us the two inequalities\n\n$$\nf(g(y+\\epsilon)) \\leqslant \\frac{2-g(y+\\epsilon) f(y+\\epsilon)}{y+\\epsilon} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(g(y+\\epsilon))>\\frac{2-g(y+\\epsilon) f(y)}{y} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nCombining these two inequalities and rearranging the terms leads to the inequality\n\n$$\n2 \\epsilon<g(y+\\epsilon)[(y+\\epsilon) f(y)-y f(y+\\epsilon)] \\text {. }\n$$\n\nMoreover combining with the inequality (1) we obtain\n\n$$\n2 \\epsilon<g(y+\\epsilon)\\left[(y+\\epsilon) f(y)-y\\left(\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}+f(y)\\right)\\right]=g(y+\\epsilon)\\left[\\epsilon f(y)-y \\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}\\right]\n$$\n\nWe now reach the desired contradiction, since for $\\epsilon$ sufficiently small we have that the left hand side is positive while the right hand side is negative.\n\nWith this lemma it then follows that for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ we have\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x) \\geqslant 2\n$$\n\nsince for $y=g(x)$ we have equality and by uniqueness for $y \\neq g(x)$ the inequality is strict.\n\nIn particular for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and for $y=x$ we have $2 x f(x) \\geqslant 2$, or equivalently $f(x) \\geqslant 1 / x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$.

Consequently each of these inequalities must actually be an equality, and in particular we obtain $f(x)=1 / x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$.', 'Again, let us prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ is the only solution. Let again $g(x)$ be the unique positive real number such that $(x, g(x))$ is a good pair.\n\nLemma 4. The function $f$ is strictly convex.\n\nProof. Consider the function $q_{s}(x)=f(x)+s x$ for some real number $s$.

For that particular choice of $s$, the function $q_{s}(x)$ has a unique minimum at $x=w$. However, since $q_{s}(w) \\geqslant t q_{s}(u)+(1-t) q_{s}(v)$, it must hold $q_{s}(u) \\leqslant q_{s}(w)$ or $q_{s}(v) \\leqslant q_{s}(w)$, a contradiction.\n\nLemma 5. The function $f$ is continuous.\n\nProof. Since $f$ is strictly convex and defined on an open interval, it is also continuous.\n\nwe can now prove that $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$.

Giving the squares of the board coordinates in the natural manner, colour each square where at least one of its coordinates are divisible by 3 , shown below for a $9 \\times 9$ board:\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_3586f878b12c6f3af257g-1.jpg?height=902&width=920&top_left_y=1342&top_left_x=568)\n\nThen, as each $3 \\times 3$ square on the board contains exactly 5 coloured squares, each move of the gardener will cause at most 4 trees on non-coloured squares to grow. The lumberjack may therefore cut those trees, ensuring no tree on a non-coloured square has positive height after his turn. Hence there cannot ever be more majestic trees than coloured squares, which is $5 N^{2}$.\n\nNext, we prove the gardener may ensure there are $5 N^{2}$ majestic trees. In fact, we prove this statement in a modified game which is more difficult for the gardener: on the lumberjack's turn in the modified game, he may decrement the height of all trees on the board except those the gardener did not just grow, in addition to four of the trees the gardener just grew. Clearly, a sequence of moves for the gardener which ensures that there are $K$ majestic trees in the modified game also ensures this in the original game.\n\n\n\nLet $M=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}9 \\\\ 5\\end{array}\\right)$; we say that a $m a p$ is one of the $M$ possible ways to mark 5 squares on a $3 \\times 3$ board. In the modified game, after the gardener chooses a $3 \\times 3$ subboard on the board, the lumberjack chooses a map in this subboard, and the total result of the two moves is that each tree marked on the map increases its height by 1, each tree in the subboard which is not in the map remains unchanged, and each tree outside the subboard decreases its height by 1 . Also note that if the gardener chooses a $3 \\times 3$ subboard $M l$ times, the lumberjack will have to choose some map at least $l$ times, so there will be at least 5 trees which each have height $\\geqslant l$.\n\nThe strategy for the gardener will be to divide the board into $N^{2}$ disjoint $3 \\times 3$ subboards, number them $0, \\ldots, N^{2}-1$ in some order. Then, for $b=N^{2}-1, \\ldots, 0$ in order, he plays $10^{6} M(M+1)^{b}$ times on subboard number $b$. Hence, on subboard number $b$, the moves on that subboard will first ensure 5 of its trees grows by at least $10^{6}(M+1)^{b}$, and then each move after that will decrease their heights by 1 . (As the trees on subboard $b$ had height 0 before the gardener started playing there, no move made on subboards $\\geqslant b$ decreased their heights.) As the gardener makes $10^{6} M(M+1)^{b-1}+\\ldots=10^{6}\\left((M+1)^{b}-1\\right)$ moves after he finishes playing on subboard $b$, this means that on subboard $b$, there will be 5 trees of height at least $10^{6}(M+1)^{b}-10^{6}\\left((M+1)^{b}-1\\right)=10^{6}$, hence each of the subboard has 5 majestic trees, which was what we wanted.""]",['2271380'],False,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2022,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,85.9155667903979,
405,2010,Combinatorics,"Lucy starts by writing $s$ integer-valued 2022-tuples on a blackboard. After doing that, she can take any two (not necessarily distinct) tuples $\mathbf{v}=\left(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{2022}\right)$ and $\mathbf{w}=\left(w_{1}, \ldots, w_{2022}\right)$ that she has already written, and apply one of the following operations to obtain a new tuple:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w}=\left(v_{1}+w_{1}, \ldots, v_{2022}+w_{2022}\right) \\

\end{aligned}
$$

and then write this tuple on the blackboard.

It turns out that, in this way, Lucy can write any integer-valued 2022-tuple on the blackboard after finitely many steps. What is the smallest possible number $s$ of tuples that she initially wrote?","['We solve the problem for $n$-tuples for any $n \\geqslant 3$ : we will show that the answer is $s=3$, regardless of the value of $n$.\n\nFirst, let us briefly introduce some notation. For an $n$-tuple $\\mathbf{v}$, we will write $\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ for its $i$-th coordinate (where $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ ). For a positive integer $n$ and a tuple $\\mathbf{v}$ we will denote by $n \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ the tuple obtained by applying addition on $\\mathbf{v}$ with itself $n$ times. Furthermore, we denote by $\\mathbf{e}(i)$ the tuple which has $i$-th coordinate equal to one and all the other coordinates equal to zero. We say that a tuple is positive if all its coordinates are positive, and negative if all its coordinates are negative.\n\nWe will show that three tuples suffice, and then that two tuples do not suffice.\n\n**Three tuples suffice.** Write $\\mathbf{c}$ for the constant-valued tuple $\\mathbf{c}=(-1, \\ldots,-1)$.\n\nWe note that it is enough for Lucy to be able to make the tuples $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$, $\\mathbf{c}$; from those any other tuple $\\mathbf{v}$ can be made as follows. First we choose some positive integer $k$ such that $k+\\mathbf{v}_{i}>0$ for all $i$. Then, by adding a positive number of copies of $\\mathbf{c}, \\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$, she can make\n\n$$\nk \\mathbf{c}+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(1)+\\cdots+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(n)\n$$\n\nwhich we claim is equal to $\\mathbf{v}$. Indeed, this can be checked by comparing coordinates: the $i$-th coordinate of the right-hand side is $-k+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\right)=\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ as needed.\n\nLucy can take her three starting tuples to be $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$, such that $\\mathbf{a}_{i}=-i^{2}, \\mathbf{b}_{i}=i$ and $\\mathbf{c}=-1$ (as above).\n\nFor any $1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$, write $\\mathbf{d}(j)$ for the tuple $2 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}+4 j \\cdot \\mathbf{b}+\\left(2 j^{2}-1\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{c}$, which Lucy can make by adding together $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$ repeatedly. This has $i$ th term\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{d}(j)_{i} & =2 \\mathbf{a}_{i}+4 j \\mathbf{b}_{i}+\\left(2 j^{2}-1\\right) \\mathbf{c}_{i} \\\\\n& =-2 i^{2}+4 i j-\\left(2 j^{2}-1\\right) \\\\\n& =1-2(i-j)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is 1 if $j=i$, and at most -1 otherwise. Hence Lucy can produce the tuple $\\mathbf{1}=(1, \\ldots, 1)$ as $\\mathbf{d}(1) \\vee \\cdots \\vee \\mathbf{d}(n)$.\n\nShe can then produce the constant tuple $\\mathbf{0}=(0, \\ldots, 0)$ as $\\mathbf{1}+\\mathbf{c}$, and for any $1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$ she can then produce the tuple $\\mathbf{e}(j)$ as $\\mathbf{d}(j) \\vee \\mathbf{0}$. Since she can now produce $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$ and already had $\\mathbf{c}$, she can (as we argued earlier) produce any integer-valued tuple.\n\n\n\n**Two tuples do not suffice.** We start with an observation: Let $a$ be a non-negative real number and suppose that two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ satisfy $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ for some $1 \\leqslant j, k \\leqslant n$. Then we claim that the same inequality holds for $\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}$ : Indeed, the property for the sum is verified by an easy computation:\n\n$$\n(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})_{j}=\\mathbf{v}_{j}+\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}+a \\mathbf{w}_{k}=a(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})_{k}\n$$\n\nFor the second operation, we denote by $\\mathbf{m}$ the tuple $\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{m}_{j} \\geqslant \\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{m}_{j} \\geqslant \\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$. Since $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ or $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{w}_{k}$, the observation follows.\n\nAs a consequence of this observation we have that if all starting tuples satisfy such an inequality, then all generated tuples will also satisfy it, and so we would not be able to obtain every integer-valued tuple.\n\nLet us now prove that Lucy needs at least three starting tuples. For contradiction, let us suppose that Lucy started with only two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$. We are going to distinguish two cases. In the first case, suppose we can find a coordinate $i$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\geqslant 0$. Both operations preserve the sign, thus we can not generate any tuple that has negative $i$-th coordinate. Similarly for $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\leqslant 0$.\n\nSuppose the opposite, i.e., for every $i$ we have either $\\mathbf{v}_{i}>0>\\mathbf{w}_{i}$, or $\\mathbf{v}_{i}<0<\\mathbf{w}_{i}$. Since we assumed that our tuples have at least three coordinates, by pigeonhole principle there exist two coordinates $j \\neq k$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{w}_{k}$ (because there are only two possible combinations of signs).\n\nWithout loss of generality assume that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}, \\mathbf{v}_{k}>0$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}, \\mathbf{w}_{k}<0$. Let us denote the positive real number $\\mathbf{v}_{j} / \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ by $a$. If $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both inequalities $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ are satisfied. On the other hand, if $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both $\\mathbf{v}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{v}_{j}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{w}_{j}$ are satisfied. In either case, we have found the desired inequality satisfied by both starting tuples, a contradiction with the observation above.']",['3'],False,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,IMO/2022,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,112.93055555738975,
406,2011,Combinatorics,"Alice fills the fields of an $n \times n$ board with numbers from 1 to $n^{2}$, each number being used exactly once. She then counts the total number of good paths on the board. A good path is a sequence of fields of arbitrary length (including 1) such that:

(i) The first field in the sequence is one that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers,

(ii) Each subsequent field in the sequence is adjacent to the previous field,

(iii) The numbers written on the fields in the sequence are in increasing order.

Two fields are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Find the smallest possible number of good paths Alice can obtain, as a function of $n$.","['We will call any field that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers a well. Other fields will be called non-wells. Let us make a second $n \\times n$ board $B$ where in each field we will write the number of good sequences which end on the corresponding field in the original board $A$. We will thus look for the minimal possible value of the sum of all entries in $B$.\n\nWe note that any well has just one good path ending in it, consisting of just the well, and that any other field has the number of good paths ending in it equal to the sum of this quantity for all the adjacent fields with smaller values, since a good path can only come into the field from a field of lower value. Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in $B$ larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other.\n\nWe will now prove that the lower limit of $2 n^{2}-2 n+1$ entries can be achieved. This amounts to finding a way of marking a certain set of squares, those that have a value of 1 in $B$, such that no two unmarked squares are adjacent and that the marked squares form a connected tree with respect to adjacency.\n\nFor $n=1$ and $n=2$ the markings are respectively the lone field and the L-trimino. Now, for $n>2$, let $s=2$ for $n \\equiv 0,2 \\bmod 3$ and $s=1$ for $n \\equiv 1 \\bmod 3$. We will take indices $k$ and $l$ to be arbitrary non-negative integers. For $n \\geqslant 3$ we will construct a path of marked squares in the first two columns consisting of all squares of the form $(1, i)$ where $i$ is not of the form $6 k+s$ and $(2, j)$ where $j$ is of the form $6 k+s-1,6 k+s$ or $6+s+1$. Obviously, this path is connected. Now, let us consider the fields $(2,6 k+s)$ and $(1,6 k+s+3)$. For each considered field $(i, j)$ we will mark all squares of the form $(l, j)$ for $l>i$ and $(i+2 k, j \\pm 1)$. One can easily see that no set of marked fields will produce a cycle, that the only fields of the unmarked form $(1,6 k+s),(2+2 l+1,6 k+s \\pm 1)$ and $(2+2 l, 6 k+s+3 \\pm 1)$ and that no two are adjacent, since\n\n\n\nthe consecutive considered fields are in columns of opposite parity.

For every day a player is present on the tournament, the committee has to pay 1 coin to the hotel. The organisers want to design the schedule so as to minimise the total cost of all players' stays. Determine this minimum cost.","[""Enumerate the days of the tournament $1,2, \\ldots,\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 k \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$.

If a player arrives on day $b$ and departs on day $e$, then his stay cost is $e-b+1$. Therefore, the total stay cost is\n\n$$\n\\Sigma=\\sum_{i=1}^{2 k} e_{i}-\\sum_{i=1}^{2 k} b_{i}+n=\\sum_{i=1}^{2 k}\\left(e_{i}-b_{i}+1\\right)\n$$\n\nBounding the total cost from below. To this end, estimate $e_{i+1}-b_{i+1}+1$. Before day $b_{i+1}$, only $i$ players were present, so at most $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}i \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ matches could be played.

During the third part (after all players from $X$ have already departed) the players from $Y$ depart one by one, each playing with everyone still present just before departing.\n\nIn the middle part, everyone from $X$ should play with everyone from $Y$. Let $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{k}$ be the players in $X$, and let $T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{k}$ be the players in $Y$. Let $T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{k}$ arrive in this order; after $T_{j}$ arrives, he immediately plays with all the $S_{i}, i>j$.

Clearly, the Committee pays for each day the cost of the match of that day. Hence, we are to minimise the total cost of all matches.\n\nNotice that $Q_{2 k}$ 's departure does not precede $P_{2 k}$ 's arrival. Hence, the number of players at the tournament monotonically increases (non-strictly) until it reaches $2 k$, and then monotonically decreases (non-strictly). So, the best time to schedule the match between $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ is either when $P_{\\max (i, j)}$ arrives, or when $Q_{\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)}$ departs, in which case the cost is $\\min \\left(\\max (i, j), \\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nConversely, assuming that $i>j$, if this match is scheduled between the arrivals of $P_{i}$ and $P_{i+1}$, then its cost will be exactly $i=\\max (i, j)$. Similarly, one can make it cost $\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)$.

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.

How many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?","['First we show that this number is an upper bound for the number of cells a limp rook can visit. To do this we color the cells with four colors $A, B, C$ and $D$ in the following way: for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,0) \\bmod 2$ use $A$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,1) \\bmod 2$ use $B$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,0) \\bmod 2$ use $C$ and for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,1) \\bmod 2$ use $D$. From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_e0aff49052224377a9b8g-1.jpg?height=445&width=516&top_left_y=1882&top_left_x=770)\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell. Hence, to connect these two parts of the path, there must be\n\n\n\na path connecting the cell $(a, b+3)$ and $(a, b)$ and also a path connecting $(a+2, b+2)$ and $(a-1, b+2)$.\n\nBut these four cells are opposite vertices of a convex quadrilateral and the paths are outside of that quadrilateral and hence they must intersect. This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside.

Similarly we must have $a_{4}$ odd as well. But then $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is a product of two even numbers $\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right)$ and thus is divisible by 4 , which is a contradiction as for odd $a_{3}$ we have $a_{3}^{2}+1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 4$.\n\nHence $a_{2}$ is even.

From the given condition we get $(x+1) \\mid\\left(y^{2}+1\\right)$ and $(y+1) \\mid\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)$.

By definition, $B=(u, v)$ satisfies this condition if and only if there is a point $C=(x, y) \\in S$ such that $\\frac{1}{2}|u y-v x|=k$. (This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$.

In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$ can be modified in $2^{k-n}$ ways, giving rise to $2^{k-n}$ distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process $\\mathbf{q}$ can be achieved in that way. Indeed, it is enough to replace every switch of a lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ that occurs in $\\mathbf{q}$ by the switch of the corresponding lamp $\\ell-n$; in the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved.\n\nSwitches of each lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ had occurred in $\\mathbf{q}$ an even number of times. So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label $\\ell \\leq n$ also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same.

- On every move of his $B$ passes 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box.
- On every move of hers $A$ chooses several coins that were not involved in $B$ 's previous move and are in different boxes. She passes every chosen coin to an adjacent box.

Player $A$ 's goal is to ensure at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, regardless of how $B$ plays and how many moves are made. Find the least $N$ that enables her to succeed.","[""We argue for a general $n \\geq 7$ instead of 2012 and prove that the required minimum $N$ is $2 n-2$. For $n=2012$ this gives $N_{\\min }=4022$.\n\na) If $N=2 n-2$ player $A$ can achieve her goal. Let her start the game with a regular distribution: $n-2$ boxes with 2 coins and 2 boxes with 1 coin. Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$. Hence $B$ can make the move described above, which leads to an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ after $A^{\\prime}$ 's response.

Hence $y+z=503 k$ is even too, meaning that $k$ is even. Thus $k=2$ or $k=4$. Clearly (1) has no integer solutions for $k=4$. If $k=2$ then (1) takes the form $(y+z)^{2}-5 y z=4$.

(i) For all positive integers $m, n$ of the same colour, $f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n)$.

(ii) There are positive integers $m, n$ such that $f(m+n) \neq f(m)+f(n)$.

In a colouring of $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with $k$ colours, every integer is coloured in exactly one of the $k$ colours. In both (i) and (ii) the positive integers $m, n$ are not necessarily different.","['The answer is $k=3$.\n\nFirst we show that there is such a function and coloring for $k=3$. Consider $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ given by $f(n)=n$ for all $n \\equiv 1$ or 2 modulo 3 , and $f(n)=2 n$ for $n \\equiv 0$ modulo 3 . Moreover, give a positive integer $n$ the $i$-th color if $n \\equiv i(3)$.\n\nBy construction we have $f(1+2)=6 \\neq 3=f(1)+f(2)$ and hence $f$ has property (ii).\n\nNow let $n, m$ be positive integers with the same color $i$. If $i=0$, then $n+m$ has color 0 , so $f(n+m)=$ $2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m)$. If $i=1$, then $n+m$ has color 2 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Finally, if $i=2$, then $n+m$ has color 1 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Therefore $f$ also satisfies condition (i).\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Then there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m)+f(n)$. Choose $m$ and $n$ such that their sum is minimal among all such $m, n$ and define $a=m+n$. Then in particular for every $b<a$ we have $f(b)=b f(1)$ and $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then condition (i) for $m=n=\\frac{a}{2}$ implies $f(a)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)=f(1) a$, a contradiction. Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.', 'We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). We first notice with $m=n$ that $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nLemma 3. For every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}, f(3 n)=3 f(n)$ holds.\n\nProof. Define $c=f(n), d=f(3 n)$. Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$. In particular $a$ is odd and $a>3$. Consider the three integers $a, \\frac{a-3}{2}, \\frac{a+3}{2}$. By pigeonhole principle two of them have the same color.\n\n- If $\\frac{a-3}{2}$ and $\\frac{a+3}{2}$ have the same color, then $f(a)=\\frac{a-3}{2} f(1)+\\frac{a+3}{2} f(1)=a f(1)$.\n- If $a$ and $\\frac{a-3}{2}$ have the same color, then $3 \\frac{a-1}{2} f(1)=3 f\\left(\\frac{a-1}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{3 a-3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+f\\left(\\frac{a-3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+$ $\\frac{a-3}{2} f(1)$, so $f(a)=a f(1)$.\n- If $a$ and $\\frac{a+3}{2}$ have the same color, then $3 \\frac{a+1}{2} f(1)=3 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{3 a+3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+f\\left(\\frac{a+3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+$ $\\frac{a+3}{2} f(1)$, so $f(a)=a f(1)$.\n\nIn the three cases we find a contradiction with $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$, so it finishes the proof.', 'As before we prove that $k \\leq 3$ and for any such function and colouring we have $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nNow we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Say the two colors are white (W) and black (B). Pick $m, n$ any two integers such that $f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n)$. Without loss of generality we may assume that $m+n, m$ are black and $n$ is white.\n\nLemma 4. For all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and every $x$ whose color is black, we have $x+l m$ is black and $f(x+\\operatorname{lm})=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5. For every $l \\geq 1,2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\n\n\nProof. On the one hand we have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l-1}(2 m+n)+2^{l-1} n\\right)$. On the other hand we have\n\n$\\left.2^{l} f(m+n)=2^{l-1} \\cdot 2 f(m+n) \\neq 2^{l-1}(f(m+n)+f(m)+f(n))=2^{l-1}(f(2 m+n)+f(n))=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n\\right)\\right)+f\\left(2^{l-1} n\\right)$.\n\nTherefore $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ and $2^{l-1} n$ have different color, which means $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\nCombining the two lemmas give $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black for all $j \\geq 2^{l}$ and every $l \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $m=2^{l-1} m^{\\prime}$ with $m^{\\prime}$ odd. Let $t$ be a number such that $\\frac{2^{t}-1}{m^{\\prime}}$ is an integer and $j=\\frac{2^{t}-1}{m^{\\prime}} n \\geq 2^{l}$, i.e. $t$ is some multiple of $\\phi\\left(m^{\\prime}\\right)$.

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$. As exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even, the factors $y-x$ and $z-2$ are either both even or both odd, so their product cannot equal 6 , and thus there is no solution with $m=12$.\n\nFinally, we handle the cases $m=11$ and $m=13$, which indeed are solutions. The corresponding rectangle sets are $10 \\times 5,1 \\times 9,8 \\times 2,7 \\times 4$ and $3 \\times 6$ for $m=11$, and $10 \\times 5,9 \\times 8,4 \\times 6,3 \\times 7$ and $1 \\times 2$ for $m=13$. These sets can be found by trial and error.

622,2230,Combinatorics,"Let $k$ be a positive integer. Lexi has a dictionary $\mathcal{D}$ consisting of some $k$-letter strings containing only the letters $A$ and $B$. Lexi would like to write either the letter $A$ or the letter $B$ in each cell of a $k \times k$ grid so that each column contains a string from $\mathcal{D}$ when read from top-to-bottom and each row contains a string from $\mathcal{D}$ when read from left-to-right.

What is the smallest integer $m$ such that if $\mathcal{D}$ contains at least $m$ different strings, then Lexi can fill her grid in this manner, no matter what strings are in $\mathcal{D}$ ?","['We claim the minimum value of $m$ is $2^{k-1}$.\n\nFirstly, we provide a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of size $2^{k-1}-1$ for which Lexi cannot fill her grid. Consider the set of all length- $k$ strings containing only $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$ which end with a $B$, and remove the string consisting of $k$  $B \\mathrm{~s}$. Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

623,2231,Geometry,"Turbo the snail sits on a point on a circle with circumference 1. Given an infinite sequence of positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \ldots$. Turbo successively crawls distances $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \ldots$ around the circle, each time choosing to crawl either clockwise or counterclockwise.

For example, if the sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \ldots$ is $0.4,0.6,0.3, \ldots$, then Turbo may start crawling as follows:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_b8bb930a7b439039cf6bg-1.jpg?height=306&width=1106&top_left_y=594&top_left_x=472)

Determine the largest constant $C>0$ with the following property: for every sequence of positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \ldots$ with $c_{i}<C$ for all $i$, Turbo can (after studying the sequence) ensure that there is some point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across.","['The largest possible $C$ is $C=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor $0<C \\leqslant \\frac{1}{2}$, Turbo can simply choose an arbitrary point $P$ (different from its starting point) to avoid. When Turbo is at an arbitrary point $A$ different from $P$, the two arcs $A P$ have total length 1; therefore, the larger of the two the arcs (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ) must have length $\\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. By always choosing this larger arc (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ), Turbo will manage to avoid the point $P$ forever.\n\nFor $C>\\frac{1}{2}$, we write $C=\\frac{1}{2}+a$ with $a>0$, and we choose the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn other words, $c_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}$ if $i$ is odd and $c_{i}=\\frac{1+a}{2}<C$ when $i$ is even. We claim Turbo must eventually visit all points on the circle. This is clear when it crawls in the same direction two times in a row; after all, we have $c_{i}+c_{i+1}>1$ for all $i$. Therefore, we are left with the case that Turbo alternates crawling clockwise and crawling counterclockwise. If it, without loss of generality, starts by going clockwise, then it will always crawl a distance $\\frac{1}{2}$ clockwise followed by a distance $\\frac{1+a}{2}$ counterclockwise. The net effect is that it crawls a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise. Because $\\frac{a}{2}$ is positive, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$. After $2 N$ crawls, Turbo will have crawled a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise $N$ times, therefore having covered a total distance of $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$, meaning that it must have crawled over all points on the circle.\n\nNote: Every sequence of the form $c_{i}=x$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_{i}=y$ if $i$ is even, where $0<x, y<C$, such that $x+y \\geqslant 1$, and $x \\neq y$ satisfies the conditions with the same argument.

Find the size $M$ of the smallest (closed) interval, that we cannot force Chet out of, using a sequence of real numbers $d_{i}$ with $0<d_{i}<1$ for all $i$.\n\nThen $C=1 / M$. Indeed if for every sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots$, with $c_{i}<C$ there exists a point that Turbo can avoid, then the circle can be cut open at the avoided point and mapped to an interval of size $M$ such that Chet can stay inside this interval for any sequence of the from $c_{1} / C, c_{2} / C, \\ldots$, see Figure 5 . However, all sequences $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ with $d_{i}<1$ can be written in this form. Similarly if for every sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$, there exists an interval of length smaller or equal $M$ that we cannot force Chet out of, this projects to a subset of the circle, that we cannot force Turbo out of using any sequence of the form $d_{1} / M, d_{2} / M, \\ldots$.

Suppose not, so $M<2$. Say $M=2-2 \\varepsilon$ for some $\\varepsilon>0$ and let $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$ be a minimal interval, that Chet cannot be forced out of. Then we can force Chet arbitrarily close to $\\pm(1-\\varepsilon)$. In partiular, we can force Chet out of $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$ by minimality of $M$. This means that there exists a sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ for which Chet has to leave $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, which means he ends up either in the interval $\\left[-1+\\varepsilon,-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ or in the interval $\\left(1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon\\right]$.\n\nNow consider the sequence,\n\n$$\nd_{1}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{2}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{3}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nobtained by adding the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ in between every two steps. We claim that this sequence forces Chet to leave the larger interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed no two consecutive elements in the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ can have the same sign, because the sum of any two consecutive terms is larger than $2-2 \\varepsilon$ and Chet would leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. It follows that the $\\left(1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's and the $\\left(1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's cancel out, so the position after $d_{k}$ is the same as before $d_{k+1}$. Hence, the positions after each $d_{k}$ remain the same as in the original sequence. Thus, Chet is also forced to the boundary in the new sequence.\n\nIf Chet is outside the interval $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, then Chet has to move $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ towards 0 , and ends in $\\left[-\\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon, \\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon\\right]$. Chet then has to move by $1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon$, which means that he has to leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed the absolute value of the final position is at least $1-\\frac{5}{6} \\varepsilon$. This contradicts the assumption, that we cannot force Chet out of $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$.

(This is because if $x=0$, then $y=\\frac{0^{2}}{k}-5=-5$ and if $(x, y)=(0,-5)$, then $x^{2}+y^{2}=0^{2}+(-5)^{2}=25$, so $(0,-5)$ satisfies each of the equations.)\n\nTherefore, for every positive integer $k$, the two graphs intersect in at least one point.\n\nIf $y=-5$, then $x^{2}+(-5)^{2}=25$ and so $x^{2}=0$ or $x=0$.

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 . (Intuitively, we do this because the problem seems to involve multiples of 5 and multiples of 8 , and $5 \\times 8=40$.)\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 1 , then $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+21$ or $n=40 k+31$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 6 , then $n=40 k+6$ or $n=40 k+16$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n=40 k+1$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 f(n) & =\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(40 k+1)(40 k+2)(40 k+3)(40 k+4)}{8} \\\\\n& =(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe units digit of $40 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $20 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $40 k+3$ is 3 , and the units digit of $10 k+1$ is 1 , so the units digit of the product is the units digit of $(1)(1)(3)(1)$ or 3.\n\nIn a similar way, we treat the remaining seven cases and summarize all eight cases in a chart:\n\n| $n$ | $3 f(n)$ simplified | Units digit of $3 f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $40 k+1$ | $(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+11$ | $(40 k+11)(10 k+3)(40 k+13)(20 k+7)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+21$ | $(40 k+21)(20 k+11)(40 k+23)(10 k+6)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+31$ | $(40 k+31)(10 k+8)(40 k+33)(20 k+17)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+6$ | $(20 k+3)(40 k+7)(10 k+2)(40 k+9)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+16$ | $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+26$ | $(20 k+13)(40 k+27)(10 k+7)(40 k+29)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+36$ | $(10 k+9)(40 k+37)(20 k+19)(40 k+39)$ | 3 |\n\n(Note that, for example, when $n=40 k+16$, the simplified version of $3 f(n)$ is $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$, so the units digit of $3 f(n)$ is the units digit of $(4)(7)(9)(9)$ which is the units digit of 2268 , or 8 .)\n\nTherefore, $f(n)$ has units digit 1 whenever $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nThere are 4 such integers $n$ between each pair of consecutive multiples of 40 .\n\nSince $2000=50 \\times 40$, then 2000 is the 50 th multiple of 40 , so there are $50 \\times 4=200$ integers $n$ less than 2000 for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, inclusive, there are two additional integers: $n=40(50)+1=2001$ and $n=40(50)+11=2011$.\n\nIn total, 202 of the integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1 .']",['202'],False,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,EMC/2014,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,73.2976485166894,EMC/2014

This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$.

This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 .

Join $S$ and $T$. By symmetry, $M$ lies directly above $S T$. Since $A B N P$ is a rectangle and $S$ and $T$ are the midpoints of opposite sides, then $S T=A P=2 \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $\\triangle P M N$ is right-angled and isosceles, then $M T$ is perpendicular to $P N$.

For each positive integer $n \geq 2$, define $P(n)$ to be the number of multiplicative partitions of $n$. We also define $P(1)=1$. Note that $P(40)=7$, since the multiplicative partitions of 40 are $40,2 \times 20,4 \times 10$, $5 \times 8,2 \times 2 \times 10,2 \times 4 \times 5$, and $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 5$.

(In each part, we use ""partition"" to mean ""multiplicative partition"". We also call the numbers being multiplied together in a given partition the ""parts"" of the partition.)

It will turn out that this value does not depend on $p$ and $q$. This value will be the value of $P(1000)$, since 1000 has this form of prime factorization.\n\nLet $n=p^{3} q^{3}$ for distinct prime numbers $p$ and $q$.\n\nThe integer $n$ has three prime factors equal to $p$.\n\nIn a given partition, these can be all together in one part (as $p^{3}$ ), can be split between two different parts (as $p$ and $p^{2}$ ), or can be split between three different parts (as $p, p$ and $p)$. There are no other ways to divide up three divisors of $p$.\n\nSimilarly, $n$ has three prime factors equal to $q$ which can be divided in similar ways.\n\nWe determine $P\\left(p^{3} q^{3}\\right)$ by considering the possible combination of the number of parts divisible by $p$ and the number of parts divisible by $q$ and counting partitions in each case.

Thus, an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k+1)$ cannot include $2 k+1$, since it would then have to include a larger even positive integer, which it cannot. Therefore, an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k+1)$ has largest term at most $2 k$ and so is an $\\operatorname{ES}(2 k)$.\n\nThus, $A(2 k+1) \\leq A(2 k)$.\n\nBut from above, $A(2 k+1) \\geq A(2 k)$, and so $A(2 k+1)=A(2 k)$.\n\n(ii) An ESO must end with an odd integer. Thus, an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k)$ cannot include $2 k$, since it would then have to include a larger odd positive integer, which it cannot. Therefore, an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k)$ has largest term at most $2 k-1$ and so is an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k-1)$. Thus, $B(2 k) \\leq B(2 k-1)$.\n\nBut from above, $B(2 k) \\geq B(2 k-1)$, and so $B(2 k)=B(2 k-1)$.\n\n(iii) An $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k)$ either includes $2 k$ or does not include $2 k$.\n\nIf such a sequence includes $2 k$, then removing the $2 k$ produces an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k-1)$. Also, every $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k-1)$ can be produced in this way.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $B(2 k-1)$.\n\nIf such a sequence does not include $2 k$, then the sequence can be thought of as an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k-1)$. Note that every $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k-1)$ is an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $A(2 k-1)$.\n\nThus, $A(2 k)=A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1)$.\n\n(iv) $\\operatorname{An} \\operatorname{ESO}(2 k+1)$ is either the one term sequence $2 k+1$, or includes $2 k+1$ and more terms, or does not include $2 k+1$.\n\nThere is 1 sequence of the first kind.\n\nAs in (iii), there are $A(2 k)$ sequences of the second kind and $B(2 k)$ sequences of the third kind.\n\nThus, $B(2 k+1)=1+A(2 k)+B(2 k)$.\n\nCombining these facts, for each positive integer $k$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k+1) & =A(2 k+1)+B(2 k+1) \\\\\n& =A(2 k)+(A(2 k)+B(2 k)+1) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k)+B(2 k))+A(2 k)+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+e(2 k-1)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k) & =A(2 k)+B(2 k) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+B(2 k-1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+(A(2 k-2)+B(2 k-2)+1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+e(2 k-2)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $n \\geq 3$, we have $e(n)=e(n-1)+e(n-2)+1$, as required.\n\n\n\nMethod 2 \n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer with $n \\geq 3$, and consider the $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$.\n\nWe divide the sequences into three sets:\n\n(i) The sequence 1 (there is 1 such sequence)\n\n(ii) The sequences which begin with 1 and have more than 1 term\n\n(iii) The sequences which do not begin with 1\n\nWe show that in case (ii) there are $e(n-1)$ sequences and in case (iii) there are $e(n-2)$ sequences.

Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 1). Also, each sequence in $R$ can be obtained in this way (since adding 1 to each term in one of these ES gives a distinct sequence in $Q$ ).\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $e(n-1)$.\n\n(iii) Consider the set of $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$ that do not begin with 1 .

Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-2\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 2). Also, each sequence in $U$ can be obtained in this way (since adding 2 to each term in one of these $\\mathrm{ES}$ gives a distinct sequence in $U$ ).\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $e(n-2)$.\n\nThis concludes our proof and shows that $e(n)=1+e(n-1)+e(n-2)$, as required.']","['$6764$,$10945$']",True,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,EMC/2012,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,70.61158559279193,EMC/2012

Through this solution, we will use the following facts:

When an acute triangle is inscribed in a circle:

- each of the three angles of the triangle is the angle inscribed in the major arc defined by the side of the triangle by which it is subtended,
- each of the three arcs into which the circle is divided by the vertices of the triangles is less than half of the circumference of the circle, and
- it contains the centre of the circle.

Why are these facts true?

- Consider a chord of a circle which is not a diameter.

Then the angle subtended in the major arc of this circle is an acute angle and the angle subtended in the minor arc is an obtuse angle.

Now consider an acute triangle inscribed in a circle.

Since each angle of the triangle is acute, then each of the three angles is inscribed in the major arc defined by the side of the triangle by which it is subtended.

- It follows that each arc of the circle that is outside the triangle must be a minor arc, thus less than the circumference of the circle.
- Lastly, if the centre was outside the triangle, then we would be able to draw a diameter of the circle with the triangle entirely on one side of the diameter.

In this case, one of the arcs of the circle cut off by one of the sides of the triangle would have to be a major arc, which cannot happen, because of the above.

We focus on the factor of 41 first.\n\nFor the numerator to contain a factor of 41 , either $n$ is divisible by 41 or one of the terms in the product $(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)$ is divisible by 41 .\n\nCase 1: $n$ is divisible by 41\n\nWe already know that $n=82$ is too large, so we consider $n=41$. From the original interpretation of $f(n, k)$, we see that $k \\leq 20$, as there can be no more than 20 gifts placed on 41 plates.\n\nHere, the numerator becomes 41 times the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers, the largest of which is $40-k$.\n\nNow the numerator must also contain at least two factors of 7 more than the denominator. But the denominator is the product of $k$ consecutive integers. Since the numerator contains the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers and the denominator contains the product of $k$ consecutive integers, then the denominator will always include at least as many multiples of 7 as the numerator (since there are more consecutive integers in the product in the denominator). Thus, it is impossible for the numerator to contain even one more\n\n\n\nadditional factor of 7 than the denominator.\n\nTherefore, if $n=41$, then $f(n, k)$ cannot be divisible by 2009 .\n\nCase 2: $n$ is not divisible by 41\n\nThis means that the factor of 41 in the numerator must occur in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the integer 41 must occur in this product, since an occurrence of 82 would make $n$ greater than 82 , which does not minimize $n+k$.\n\nSo we try to find values of $n$ and $k$ that include the integer 41 in this list.\n\nNote that $n-k-1$ is the largest factor in the product and $n-2 k+1$ is the smallest.\n\nSince 41 is contained somewhere in the product, then $n-2 k+1 \\leq 41$ (giving $n \\leq 40+2 k$ ) and $41 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 42+k$ ).\n\nCombining these restrictions, we get $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nNow, we focus on the factors of 7 .\n\nEither $n$ is not divisible by 7 or $n$ is divisible by 7 .\n\n* If $n$ is not divisible by 7 , then at least two factors of 7 must be included in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nwhich means that either $k \\geq 8$ (to give two multiples of 7 in this list of $k-1$ consecutive integers) or one of the factors is divisible by 49 .\n\n- If $k \\geq 8$, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 50$ so $n+k \\geq 58$, which is not minimal.\n- If one of the factors is a multiple of 49 , then 49 must be included in the list so $n-2 k+1 \\leq 49$ (giving $n \\leq 48+2 k$ ) and $49 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 50+k$ ).

On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.
Ross takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\left(n_{1}, 34\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \ldots$, and each time, $d\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\right)=1 / 3$. At the end of the day, what is his maximum possible distance from his original house? Justify your answer.","['The maximum possible distance $d\\left(34, n_{k}\\right)$ is $1 / 3$.

1094,2702,Algebra,"In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\prime}$, where $k \geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum ""location, location, location,"" this Power Question will refer to ""houses"" and ""house numbers"" interchangeably.

Curiously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.


The neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\mathcal{N}(n)=\{m \mid d(m)=d(n)\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.

Later, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\prime} / q^{\prime}$, where neither $p^{\prime}$ nor $q^{\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.

Because the octahedron is only being stretched in one dimension, the volume changes by the same factor $r$. So the problem reduces to computing the factor $r$ and the edge length of the resulting octahedron.\n\nFor convenience, imagine that one face of the octahedron rests on a plane. Seen from above the plane, the octahedron appears as shown below.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_6337ac12aa6d82067ee9g-1.jpg?height=407&width=395&top_left_y=249&top_left_x=903)\n\nLet $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto the plane on which the octahedron rests, and let $Q$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{B C}$.

Define the sequence $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \ldots$ by setting $s_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{20} \underbrace{(f \circ \cdots \circ f)}_{n}(k)$. That is, $s_{1}=f(1)+$ $\cdots+f(20), s_{2}=f(f(1))+\cdots+f(f(20)), s_{3}=f(f(f(1)))+f(f(f(2)))+\cdots+f(f(f(20)))$, etc. Compute the smallest integer $p$ such that the following statement is true: The sequence $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \ldots$ must be periodic after a certain point, and its period is at most $p$. (If the sequence is never periodic, then write $\infty$ as your answer.)","[""If $f$ is simply a permutation of $S$, then $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is periodic. To understand why, consider a smaller set $T=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$. If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 . However,\n\n$$\nf(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)+f(6)+f(7)+f(8)+f(9)+f(10)=\n$$\n\n\n\n$$\n2+3+4+5+1+7+8+6+9+10=55,\n$$\n\nbecause $f$ just rearranges the order of the summands. So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$.

The Cop number of a map $M$, denoted $C(M)$, is the minimum number of Cops required to guarantee that the Robber is caught.


The police want to catch the Robber with a minimum number of Cops, but time is of the essence. For a map $M$ and a fixed number of Cops $c \geq C(M)$, define the capture time, denoted $D(M, c)$, to be the minimum number of days required to guarantee a capture using $c$ Cops. For example, in the graph below, if three Cops are deployed, they might catch the Robber in the first day, but if they don't, there is a strategy that will guarantee they will capture the Robber within two days. Therefore the capture time is $D\left(\mathcal{C}_{6}, 3\right)=2$.

Definition: The workday number of $M$, denoted $W(M)$, is the minimum number of Cop workdays needed to guarantee the Robber's capture. For example, a strategy that guarantees capture within three days using 17 Cops on the first day, 11 Cops on the second day, and only 6 Cops on the third day would require a total of $17+11+6=34$ Cop workdays.

figure b","['or the map $M$ from figure a, $W(M)=7$. The most efficient strategy is to use 7 Cops to blanket all the hideouts on the first day. Any strategy using fewer than 7 Cops would require 6 Cops on each of two consecutive days: given that any hideout can be reached from any other hideout, leaving more than one hideout unsearched on one day makes it is impossible to eliminate any hideouts the following day. So any other strategy would require a minimum of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nFor the map $M$ from figure b, $W(M)=8$. The strategy outlined in $2 \\mathrm{~b}$ used three Cops for a maximum of four workdays, yielding 12 Cop workdays. The most efficient strategy is to use 4 Cops, positioned at $\\{B, E, H, K\\}$ for 2 days each. The following argument demonstrates that 8 Cop workdays is in fact minimal. First, notice that there is no advantage to searching one of the hideouts between vertices of the square (for example, $C$ ) without searching the other hideout between the same vertices (for example, $D$ ). The Robber can reach $C$ on day $n$ if and only if he is at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n-1$, and in either case he could just as well go to $D$ instead of $C$. So there is no situation in which the Robber is certain to be caught at $C$ rather than at $D$. Additionally, the Robber\'s possible locations on day $n+1$ are the same whether he is at $C$ or $D$ on day $n$, so searching one rather than the other fails to rule out any locations for future days. So any successful strategy that involves searching $C$ should also involve searching $D$ on the same day, and similarly for $F$ and $G, I$ and $J$, and $L$ and $A$. On the other hand, if the Robber must be at one of $C$ and $D$ on day $n$, then he must be at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n+1$, because those are the only adjacent hideouts. So any strategy that involves searching both hideouts of one of the off-the-square pairs on day $n$ is equivalent to a strategy that searches the adjacent on-the-square hideouts on day $n+1$; the two strategies use the same number of Cops for the same number of workdays. Thus the optimal number of Cop workdays can be achieved using strategies that only search the ""corner"" hideouts $B, E, H, K$.\n\nRestricting the search to only those strategies searching corner hideouts $B, E, H, K$, a total of 8 workdays can be achieved by searching all four hideouts on two consecutive days: if the Robber is at one of the other eight hideouts the first day, he must move to one of the two adjacent corner hideouts the second day. But each of these corner hideouts is adjacent to two other corner hideouts. So if only one hideout is searched, for no matter how many consecutive days, the following day, the Robber could either be back at the previously-searched hideout or be at any other hideout: no possibilities are ruled out. If two adjacent corners are searched, the Cops do no better, as the following argument shows. Suppose that $B$ and $E$ are both searched for two consecutive days. Then the Cops can rule out $B, E, C$, and $D$ as possible locations, but if the Cops then switch to searching either $H$ or $K$ instead of $B$ or $E$, the Robber can go back to $C$ or $D$ within two days. So searching two adjacent corner hideouts for two days is fruitless and costs four Cop workdays. Searching diagonally opposite corner hideouts is even less fruitful, because doing so rules out none of the other hideouts as possible Robber locations. Using three Cops each day, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which the Robber evades capture for three days before being caught: for example, if $B, E, H$ are searched for two consecutive days, the Robber goes from $I$ or $J$ to $K$ to $L$. Therefore if three Cops are used, four days are required for a total of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nIf there are more than four Cops, the preceding arguments show that the number of Cops must be even to produce optimal results (because there is no advantage to searching one hideout between vertices of the square without searching the other). Using six Cops with four at corner hideouts yields no improvement, because the following day, the Robber could get to any of the four corner hideouts, requiring at least four Cops the second day, for ten Cop workdays. If two or fewer Cops are at corner hideouts, the situation is even worse, because if the Robber is not caught that day, he has at least nine possible hideouts the following day (depending on whether the unsearched corners are adjacent or diagonally opposite to each other). Using eight Cops (with four at corner vertices) could eliminate one corner vertex as a possible location for the second day (if the non-corner hideouts searched are on adjacent sides of the square), but eight Cop workdays have already been used on the first day. So 8 Cop workdays is minimal.']","['12, 8']",True,,Numerical,,Open-ended_Questions,ARML/2012,True,English_Olympiad_Mathematics,7.0097419453071135,ARML/2012

This is impossible, since the $p$-signature is well-defined.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose $\\sigma$ is a $p$-signature such that that every pair of consecutive windows is compatible. We need to show that there is at least one label $L$ with $S_{p}[L]=\\sigma$. We do so by induction on the number of windows in $\\sigma$, using the results from $5(\\mathrm{~b})$.\n\nLet $\\sigma=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$, and suppose $\\omega_{1}=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{p}$. Set $L_{1}=\\omega_{1}$.\n\nSuppose that $L_{k}$ is a $(p+k-1)$-label such that $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k}\\right\\}$. We will construct $L_{k+1}$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k+1}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$.\n\nAs in $5(\\mathrm{~b})$, denote by $L_{k}^{(j)}$ the label $L_{k}$ with a $j+0.5$ appended; we will eventually renumber the elements in the label to make them all integers. Appending $j+0.5$ does not affect any of the non-terminal windows of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]$, and as $j$ varies from 0 to $p-k+1$ the final window of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$ varies over each of the $p$ windows compatible with $\\omega_{k}$. Since $\\omega_{k+1}$ is compatible with $\\omega_{k}$, there exists some $j$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$. Now we renumber as follows: set $L_{k+1}=S_{k+p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$, which replaces $L_{k}^{(j)}$ with the integers 1 through $k+p$ and preserves the relative order of all integers in the label.\n\nBy continuing this process, we conclude that the $n$-label $L_{n-p+1}$ has $p$-signature $\\sigma$, so $\\sigma$ is possible.\n\nTo count the number of possible $p$-signatures, we choose the first window ( $p$ ! choices), then choose each of the remaining $n-p$ compatible windows ( $p$ choices each).

That is, the distance between them in the $n$-label is less than $p$.\n\nProof: Suppose that for some $k$, the distance between $k$ and $k+1$ is $p$ or greater. Then the label $L^{\\prime}$ obtained by swapping $k$ and $k+1$ has the same $p$-signature, because there are no numbers between $k$ and $k+1$ in any window and because the two numbers never appear in the same window.\n\nIf the distance between all such pairs is less than $k$, we need to show that $S_{p}[L]$ is unique. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, let $r_{i}$ denote the position where $i$ appears in $L$. For example, if $L=4123$, then $r_{1}=2, r_{2}=3, r_{3}=4$, and $r_{4}=1$.\n\nLet $L=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$.

Compute the remainder when the sum of the elements of $\mathcal{S}$ is divided by 10,000.","[""The remainders of an integer $N$ modulo $2^{4}=16$ and $5^{4}=625$ uniquely determine its remainder modulo 10000. There are only 16 strings of four 0's and 1's. In addition, because 16 and 625 are relatively prime, it will be shown below that for each such string $s$, there exists exactly one integer $x_{s}$ in the range $0 \\leq x_{s}<10000$ such that the base- 2 and base- 5 representations of $x_{s}$ end in the digits of $s$ (e.g., $x_{1001}$ is the unique positive integer less than 10000 such that $x$ 's base- 5 representation and base- 2 representation both end in 1001).\n\nHere is a proof of the preceding claim: Let $p(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 5 are the string $s$, and $b(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 2 are the string $s$. Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. These reduce to the Diophantine equation $16 n-625 m=p(s)-b(s)$, which has solutions $m, n$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$, with at least one of $m, n \\geq 0$. Assuming without loss of generality that $m>0$ yields $x=p(s)+625 m \\geq 0$. To show that there exists an $x_{s}<10000$ and that it is unique, observe that the general form of the solution is $m^{\\prime}=m-16 t, n^{\\prime}=n+625 t$. Thus if $p(s)+625 m>10000$, an appropriate $t$ can be found by writing $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, which yields $p(s)+625 m-10000<10000 t \\leq p(s)+625 m$. Because there are exactly 10000 integers in that interval, exactly one of them is divisible by 10000 , so there is exactly one value of $t$ satisfying $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, and set $x_{s}=625(m-16 t)$.\n\nTherefore there will be 16 integers whose base- 2 and base- 5 representations end in the same four digits, possibly with leading 0 's as in the example. Let $X=x_{0000}+\\cdots+x_{1111}$. Then $X$ is congruent modulo 16 to $0000_{2}+\\cdots+1111_{2}=8 \\cdot\\left(1111_{2}\\right)=8 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 8$.

Each non-zero digit contributes an equal number of times, so there are 200 each of $1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9$. The same applies to the tens digit, except there can be the stray digit of 1 among the numbers 2010 through 2019, but again, these do not affect the product.

Denote these four sequences by $A, B, C, D$.\n\n|  | $T$ | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | 49 | 64 | 81 | 100 |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $d=7:$ | $A$ | 7 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 70 |\n| $d=5:$ | $B$ | 16 | 21 | 26 | 31 | 36 | 41 | 46 | 51 | 56 | 61 |\n| $d=3:$ | $C$ | 25 | 28 | 31 | 34 | 37 | 40 | 43 | 46 | 49 | 52 |\n| $d=1:$ | $D$ | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 | 42 | 43 |\n\nStep 2. Given any two sequences $X=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{10}\\right)$ and $Y=\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{10}\\right)$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_{i}=385$, define the taxicab distance\n\n$$\n\\rho(X, Y)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left|x_{i}-y_{i}\\right|\n$$\n\nObserve that if $X^{\\prime}$ is a morph of $X$, then $\\rho\\left(X^{\\prime}, Y\\right) \\geq \\rho(X, Y)-2$. Therefore the number of morphs required to transform $T$ into some sequence $Z$ is at least $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho(T, Z)$. Now\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\rho(T, A)=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left|i^{2}-7 i\\right|=56\n$$\n\nand also $\\rho(T, A)<\\min (\\rho(T, B), \\rho(T, C), \\rho(T, D))$. Thus at least 56 morphs are needed to obtain sequence $A$ (and more morphs would be required to obtain any of sequences $B, C$, or $D$ ).\n\nStep 3. To conclude, it remains to verify that one can make 56 morphs and arrive from $T$ to $A$.

In fact, about 700 years before Pascal, the Indian mathematician Halayudha wrote about it in his commentaries to a then-1000-year-old treatise on verse structure by the Indian poet and mathematician Pingala, who called it the Meruprastāra, or ""Mountain of Gems"". In this Power Question, we'll explore some properties of Pingala's/Pascal's Triangle (""PT"") and its variants.

Unless otherwise specified, the only definition, notation, and formulas you may use for PT are the definition, notation, and formulas given below.

PT consists of an infinite number of rows, numbered from 0 onwards. The $n^{\text {th }}$ row contains $n+1$ numbers, identified as $\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$, where $0 \leq k \leq n$. For all $n$, define $\mathrm{Pa}(n, 0)=\operatorname{Pa}(n, n)=1$. Then for $n>1$ and $1 \leq k \leq n-1$, define $\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k-1)+\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k)$. It is convenient to define $\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=0$ when $k<0$ or $k>n$. We write the nonzero values of $\mathrm{PT}$ in the familiar pyramid shown below.

As is well known, $\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ gives the number of ways of choosing a committee of $k$ people from a set of $n$ people, so a simple formula for $\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ is $\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\frac{n !}{k !(n-k) !}$. You may use this formula or the recursive definition above throughout this Power Question.
