Proof: We can divide the sector into arbitrarily small sectors that can be approximated as isosceles triangles. It's well known that the center of mass of one such isosceles triangle is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from the central vertex to the base. Therefore, the center of mass of the sector is the center of mass of the arc with central angle $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and same center with radius $\\frac{2}{3}$ contained within the sector. Since the center of mass has to lie on the axis of symmetry, we set that as the $\\mathrm{x}$ axis with the vertex of the sector being $x=0$.

        "solution": [
            "Let $x$ be the distance from a point on the unstretched elastic string to the center of rotation (child's hand). Note that $x$ varies from 0 to $L$. However, the string stretches, so let $r$ be the distance from a point on the stretched string (in steady state) to the center of rotation. Let $T$ be the tension in the string as a function of position. Let $\\lambda=\\frac{m}{L}$. Consider a portion of the string $d x$. We know that the portion as spring constant $k \\frac{L}{d x}$ and it is stretched by $d r-d x$, so by Hooke's Law, we have $T=k \\frac{L}{d x}(d r-d x)=k L\\left(\\frac{d r}{d x}-1\\right)$. Also, by applying Newton's Second Law on the portion, we get $d T=-\\lambda d x \\cdot \\omega^{2} r$, which implies $\\frac{d T}{d x}=-\\lambda \\omega^{2} r$. Combining the two equations, we obtain\n$$\nT=-k L\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda \\omega^{2}} T^{\\prime \\prime}+1\\right)\n$$\nWe know that\n$$\nT^{\\prime}(x=0)=0,\n$$\nsince $r=0$ when $x=0$. The general solution is\n$$\nT=A \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} x\\right)-k L\n$$\nfor some constant $A$. Thus, we have\n$$\nr=-\\frac{1}{\\lambda \\omega^{2}} T^{\\prime}=\\frac{A}{\\omega \\sqrt{k m}} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} x\\right)\n$$\nAlso, we have that\n$$\nT(x=L)=M \\omega^{2} \\int_{0}^{L} r x d x=M \\omega^{2} \\int_{0}^{L}\\left(\\frac{T}{k L}+1\\right) x .\n$$\nPlugging in our general solution, we can get $A \\cos \\left(\\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}\\right)-k L=M \\omega^{2} \\cdot \\frac{A}{k L} \\frac{L}{\\omega} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\sin \\left(\\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}\\right)$. Solving for $A$, we obtain\n$$\nA=\\frac{k L}{\\cos \\left(\\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}\\right)-\\frac{M \\omega}{\\sqrt{k m}} \\sin \\left(\\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}\\right)}\n$$\nWe now introduce a claim:\n\n\n\nClaim. The speed of a longitudinal wave on a spring with spring constant $k$, length $L$, and mass $m$ is given by $v=L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nProof. Let a spring with spring constant $k$ and mass $m$ be stretched to length $L$. The spring constant of a small portion $d x$ of the spring is $k \\frac{L}{d x}$, and the excess tension is $\\delta T=k \\frac{L}{d x} d s=k L \\frac{d s}{d x}$, where $s$ is the displacement from equilibrium. By Newton's second law on the portion, we get $d T=\\frac{m}{L} d x \\cdot \\frac{d^{2} s}{d t^{2}}$, or $\\frac{d T}{d x}=\\frac{m}{L} \\frac{d^{2} s}{d t^{2}}$. Thus, $L^{2} \\frac{k}{m} \\frac{d^{2} s}{d x^{2}}=\\frac{d^{2} s}{d t^{2}}$, which we recognize as the wave equation with speed $v=L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$ and the time it takes to traverse the spring is $\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$.\n\nThus, we have\n$$\nt=\\int d t=\\int_{0}^{x} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda d x}{k \\cdot \\frac{L}{d x}}}=\\int_{0}^{x} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{k L}} d x=\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nSince we know $x=L$ when $t=T_{0}$, we have $x=\\frac{L}{2}$ when $t=\\frac{T_{0}}{2}$. Therefore, our answer is\n$$\nr=\\frac{A}{\\omega \\sqrt{k m}} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} x\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\omega} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\frac{L \\sin \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}\\right)}{\\cos \\left(\\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}\\right)-\\frac{M \\omega}{\\sqrt{k m}} \\sin \\left(\\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}\\right)}=1.903 \\mathrm{~m}\n$$"

This distance can be derived to be:\n\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{optimal}}=\\frac{v^{2} / g}{1+\\sin \\beta}\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\beta$ is negative if it's tilting downwards. We get the systems of equations:\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{v^{2} / g_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1+\\sin \\beta}=0.25+0.25 \\cdot \\frac{13}{20}\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{v^{2} / g_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1-\\sin \\beta}=1\n\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}}=g / \\cos \\beta\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nand solving gives $v=2.51 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\n\nMethod Two: Looking at the minor axis is much easier. The wind doesn't contribute in this direction, so we know the furthest point must have a vertical displacement of $d_{\\max }=\\frac{v^{2}}{g}$. We measure $d_{\\max }=0.50+0.25 \\cdot \\frac{11}{20}$ and solving for $v$ gives $d_{\\max }=2.50 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nNote that the answers aren't exactly the same due to measurement inaccuracies, so we asked for two significant digits. An earlier version of the question had the same diagram, but the labels were accidentally shifted. This did not affect the final answer."

A very small hole of area $A$ is punched in the side of the box. The number of nieons that escape the box per unit time is given by\n$$\n\\alpha v^{\\beta} A^{\\gamma} \\rho^{\\delta}\n\\tag{10}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$, and $\\delta$ are all dimensionless constants. Calculate $\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma+\\delta$.",
        "solution": [
            "The main idea is this: if a nieon is to escape in time $\\Delta t$, then it must be traveling towards the hole and be within a hemisphere of radius $v \\Delta t$, centered on the hole.\n(Note that we will ignore all collisions between nieons. As with many calculations in these kinds of problems, collisions will not affect our answer. Even if they did, we can assume that the hole is so small that we can take $v \\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$, making the radius of the hemisphere much much smaller than the mean free path.)\n\nFirst, we will break up this hemisphere into volume elements. We will calculate how many nieons are inside each volume element. Then we will find out how many of these nieons are traveling in the direction of the hole.\n\nWe define a spherical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$. The volume of each differential element is $r^{2} \\sin \\theta d r d \\theta d \\phi$, which means that there are $\\rho r^{2} \\sin \\theta d r d \\theta d \\phi$ nieons inside this volume element.\n\nWithin this volume element, how many of these nieons are going towards the hole? We must think about what each nieon \"sees.\" Visualize a sphere of radius $r$ around the volume element. The surface of the sphere will pass through the small hole in the wall. Each nieon is equally likely to go in any direction and is equally likely to end up going through any patch of this spherical surface. Thus, each nieon within this volume element has a probability $A^{\\prime} / 4 \\pi r^{2}$ of going through the hole, where $A^{\\prime}$ is the perceived area of the hole from where the nieon is situated.\n\n$A^{\\prime}$ can be calculated as follows. $\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$ is the unit vector pointing perpendicular to the hole. Let $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ be the\n\n\n\nunit vector pointing from the hole to the volume element. Then it can be verified that $A^{\\prime}=A \\cos \\psi$, where $\\psi$ is the angle between $\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.\n\nExpressing $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ in terms of the other unit vectors, it can be shown that $A^{\\prime}=A \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi$. Hence, the fraction of nieons inside the volume element that are going towards the hole is\n\n$$\n\\frac{A \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi}{4 \\pi r^{2}}\n$$\n\nIntegrating over the entire hemisphere, the number of nieons escaping through the hole in a time $\\Delta t$ is\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{v \\Delta t} d r \\int_{0}^{\\pi} d \\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi} d \\theta\\left(\\frac{A}{4 \\pi r^{2}} \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi\\right)\\left(\\rho r^{2} \\sin \\theta\\right)=\\frac{1}{4} v A \\rho \\cdot \\Delta t\n$$"

One way to do it is to use the safety parabola, which makes it so minimal calculations are needed, so we present that method here. However, this problem is also readily solvable with only basic kinematics.\nThe point that the ball must hit (4.15 meters in front and 1 meter above) lies on the safety parabola when it is thrown at minimum speed.

            "First note that the thread is given to be very long. Therefore, only vertical tension and gravitational forces act on the rod allowing for its center of mass to move in a straight vertical line. Using this fact, we can now write the acceleration of the rod in terms of angular velocity $\\omega$ and angular acceleration $\\varepsilon$. Let the angle of the rod at any moment to the vertical be $\\varphi$. For simplicity, we define the length of the rod to be $2 l$. Then, by defining the coordinate $y$ to be the change in vertical length of the rod where $y=l \\cos \\varphi$, one can write for varying $\\varphi \\in[\\varphi, \\varphi+\\mathrm{d} \\varphi)$ that $l \\cos (\\varphi+\\mathrm{d} \\varphi)=y+\\mathrm{d} y \\Longrightarrow \\mathrm{d} y=l \\sin \\varphi \\mathrm{d} \\varphi$. Thus, simple differentiation proves that\n$$\nv=l \\sin \\varphi \\omega \\Longrightarrow a=l \\varepsilon \\sin \\varphi+l \\omega^{2} \\cos \\varphi\n$$\n\nWe can now also write conservation of energy to get another relationship between velocity and angular velocity. At any given moment, it can be written that $m g l=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^{2}-m g l \\cos \\varphi$.

We can finally get a fourth equation by equating torques such that $\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2} \\varepsilon=T l \\sin \\varphi$. With these four equations, simple algebra yields the tension at any point is\n\n$$\nT(\\varphi)=\\frac{1+(3 \\cos \\varphi-1)^{2}}{\\left(1+3 \\sin ^{2} \\varphi\\right)^{2}} m g \\Longrightarrow T_{\\min } \\approx 0.165 m g\n$$"

Again, we perform the same steps on the four even shorter slits and continue for a very long time.\nThen, we shine a monochromatic, coherent light source of wavelength $500 \\mathrm{~nm}$ on our slits, which creates an interference pattern on a wall 10 meters away. On the wall, what is the distance between the central maximum and the first side maximum? Assume the distance to the wall is much greater than the width of the slit. Answer in millimeters.",
        "solution": [
            "This problem is essentially an infinite convolution. In detail, consider two separate amplitude functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that correspond to two different interference patterns. One can think of a convolution of $f$ and $g$ as taking $f$ and placing the same function in every position that exists in $g$. To be more specific, the amplitude of one interference pattern can be thought of as the product of the amplitude patterns of two separate amplitude functions. For example, the diffraction pattern of two slits is the same as the product of the amplitudes for one slit and two light sources (this will be given as an exercise to prove). To make more sense of this, let us consider that very example and let $f$ pertain to the amplitude function of a single slit and let $g$ pertain to the amplitude function of two light sources. One can then write in phase space with a generalized coordinate $x^{\\prime}$ that $\\{f * g\\}(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f\\left(x-x^{\\prime}\\right) g\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathrm{d} x^{\\prime}$ according to the convolution theorem. The integral then runs through all values and places a copy of $f\\left(x-x^{\\prime}\\right)$ at the peaks of $g\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)$.\nWith this in hand, we can use the convolution theorem to our advantage. Let us designate the amplitude function of the entire Cantor slit to be $F(\\theta)$. Since $\\theta$ is small, we can designate the phase angle as $\\phi=k x \\theta$ where $x$ is a variable moving through all of the slits. If we consider a single slit that is cut into a third, the angle produced will be a third of its original as well, or the new amplitude function will simply be a function of $\\theta / 3$ or $F(\\theta / 3)$. The distance between the midpoints of the two slits will simply be $d=2 / 3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ which then becomes $2 / 9$, then $2 / 27$ and so on. In terms of the original function, we can decompose it into the function of $F(\\theta / 3)$ and the amplitude function of a single light source. In other words, $F(\\theta)=F(\\theta / 3) \\cos (k d \\theta / 2)$ where $k=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda}$.

Assume $t \\ll R$. The density of air around (and inside) the ball is $\\rho_{a}$, and the air pressure is $p$, where $\\rho_{a} \\ll \\rho_{b} \\frac{t}{R}$ and $p \\ll Y \\frac{t^{3}}{R^{3}}$.\n\n\n\nAn estimate for the resonance frequency is $\\omega \\sim R^{a} t^{b} \\rho_{b}^{c} Y^{d}$. Find the value of $4 a^{2}+3 b^{2}+2 c^{2}+d^{2}$.\nHint: The surface of the ball will oscillate by \"bending\" instead of \"stretching\", since the former takes much less energy than the latter.",
        "solution": [
            "Throughout the problem, we will work to order of magnitude and ignore prefactors.\nThe hint says the surface of the ball will bend instead of stretch, so we need to develop a theory of bending. First, we consider the simplified scenario of a long beam with thickness $t$, width $w$, length $L$, made out of a material with Young's modulus $Y$ and density $\\rho$. When the beam bends, the top part of the beam will be in tension and the bottom part will be in compression. Thus, this is how the potential energy is stored in the beam. Suppose the beam is bent with curvature $\\kappa$. Then the top part of the beam will stretch by $L t \\kappa$, and the bottom part will compress by the same amount. Using Hooke's law, we can approximate the total potential energy stored in the beam as $U \\sim \\frac{Y t w}{L}(L t \\kappa)^{2} \\sim Y t^{3} w L \\kappa^{2}$. Note that if the relaxed state of the beam was already curved, we simply replace $\\kappa$ with the change in curvature.\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency of the beam, we need to find the kinetic energy in terms of $\\dot{\\kappa}$. Since curvature is on the order of second derivative of displacement, we can multiply $\\kappa$ by $L^{2}$ to get an estimate for displacement. Then $\\dot{\\kappa} L^{2}$ gives an estimate for speed, so the kinetic energy is $K \\sim \\rho t w L\\left(\\dot{\\kappa} L^{2}\\right)^{2} \\sim \\rho t w L^{5} \\dot{\\kappa}^{2}$. Thus, the frequency of oscillations is $\\omega \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{Y t^{2}}{\\rho L^{4}}}$. Again, if the beam\n\n\n\nwas already curved, we can replace $\\kappa$ everywhere with the change in curvature.\n\nWe can model the ping pong ball as a \"beam\" of length order $R$, width order $R$, and thickness $t$. This is a very crude approximation, but will give a dimensionally correct answer (since we are ignoring prefactors). The angular frequency is thus $\\omega \\sim \\frac{t}{R^{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{Y}{\\rho_{b}}}$."

If the numbers are both equal and non-zero, then the available positions $S^{\\prime}$ image the light-path from $S$ should reach are two unit-cell hyper-rows that parallel to the mirrors. If the numbers are not equal, then the available positions $S^{\\prime}$-image the light-path from $S$ should reach are one unit-cell hyper-rows that that parallel to the mirrors.\n\nSay, without loss of generality, pick one mirror to be reflected $N$ times and the rest to be reflected $N-1$ times each, then the number of light-rays for that pick should equal to the number of unit-cell intersections between all relevant unit-cell hyper-rows, which is half the total number of vertices a hyper-rectangular has, thus $2^{D-1}$. There are $2 D$ walls, thus the total number of light-rays that satisfies the task given is $2 D \\times 2^{D-1}=D 2^{D}$, independent of $N$ for all values $N>1$.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the above explanation, let's take a look at the simple case of $D=2$ and $N=2>1$. Consider a rectangular room, with random points $S, S^{\\prime}$ and $2 D=4$ walls $W_{1}, W_{2}, W_{3}, W_{4}$ (see Fig. A). Without loss of generality, we want to find light-rays that go from $S$, reflect $N=2$ times on $W_{1}$ and $N-1=1$ times on $W_{2}, W_{3}, W_{4}$ then come to $S^{\\prime}$. Each image of $S^{\\prime}$ is an unique point in a unit-cell generated by the room (see Fig. B). Note that every light-ray from $S$ that reach $S^{\\prime}$-images in the $\\rightarrow W_{2} \\rightarrow W_{4} \\rightarrow$ and $\\rightarrow W_{4} \\rightarrow W_{2} \\rightarrow$ unit-cell green-rows will satisfy the requirement of one reflection on each of $W_{2}$ and $W_{4}$, every light-ray from $S$ that reach $S^{\\prime}$-images in the $\\rightarrow W_{1} \\rightarrow W_{3} \\rightarrow W_{1} \\rightarrow$ unit-cell blue-rows will satisfy the requirement of two reflection on $W_{1}$ and one reflection on $W_{3}$ (see Fig. C). The intersection of these rows are two unit-cells, corresponds two possible images thuss two possible light-rays that satisfies the requirement (see Fig. D).\n\nFor $D=7$ and $N=3>1$, we get 896 light-rays."

Find the (electrostatic) interaction energy between the dipole and the charge induced on the spherical conductor.",
        "solution": [
            "We can use the fact that if a charge $Q$ is placed at a distance $a$ from a grounded, conducting sphere of radius $R$, as far as the field outside the sphere is concerned, there is an image charge of magnitude $-Q \\frac{R}{a}$ at a position $\\frac{R^{2}}{a}$ from the origin, on the line segment connecting the origin and charge $Q$. It is straightforward to check that indeed, the potential on the sphere due to this image charge prescription is 0 . If the point charge is instead a dipole $p$, we can think of this as a superposition of 2 point charges, and use the fact above. In particular, there is one charge $-Q$ at point $(a, 0,0)$ and another charge $Q$ at point $(a+s \\cos \\theta, s \\sin \\theta, 0)$, where $s$ is small and $Q s=p$. Note that the dipole points in the direction $\\theta$ above the $\\mathrm{x}$-axis. Consequently, there will be an image charge at $\\left(\\frac{R^{2}}{a}, 0,0\\right)$ with magnitude $Q \\frac{R}{a}$ and an image charge at $\\left(\\frac{R^{2}}{a+s \\cos \\theta}, \\frac{R^{2} s \\sin \\theta}{a(a+s \\cos \\theta)}, 0\\right)$ with magnitude $-Q \\frac{R}{a+s \\cos \\theta}$. The image charges are close to each other but do not cancel out exactly,\n\n\n\nso they can be represented as a superposition of an image point charge $Q^{\\prime}$ and an image dipole $p^{\\prime}$. The image point charge has magnitude $Q^{\\prime}=-Q R\\left(\\frac{1}{a+s \\cos \\theta}-\\frac{1}{a}\\right)=\\frac{Q R s \\cos \\theta}{a^{2}}$.

Finally, since the sphere in the problem is uncharged instead of grounded, to ensure the net charge in the sphere is 0 , we place another image charge $-Q^{\\prime}$ at the origin.\n\nNow we can calculate the desired interaction energy, which is simply the interaction energy between the image charges and the real dipole. Using the dipole-dipole interaction formula, the interaction between the image dipole and the real dipole is given by:\n\n$$\nU_{1}=\\frac{k p p^{\\prime}}{\\left(a-\\frac{R^{2}}{a}\\right)^{3}}\\left(\\cos (2 \\theta)-3 \\cos ^{2} \\theta\\right)\n$$\n\nThe interaction between the image charge at the image dipole's position and the real dipole is given by:\n\n$$\nU_{2}=-\\frac{k p Q^{\\prime} \\cos \\theta}{\\left(a-\\frac{R^{2}}{a}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe interaction between the image charge at the center and the real dipole is given by:\n\n$$\nU_{3}=\\frac{k p Q^{\\prime} \\cos \\theta}{a^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe final answer is $U=U_{1}+U_{2}+U_{3}=\\frac{p^{2} R}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}}\\left(\\frac{\\cos ^{2} \\theta}{a^{4}}-\\frac{a^{2} \\cos ^{2} \\theta+R^{2}}{\\left(a^{2}-R^{2}\\right)^{3}}\\right)=-25.22 \\mathrm{~J} .$"

Evaluate the magnitude of the integral $|\\mathbf{I}|$ (in SI units).",
        "solution": [
            "First, note that the result of the integral will be a vector in the direction the dipole is pointing, call it the z-direction. Thus we can replace $\\mathbf{B}$ in the integral with $B_{z}$. Note that for any $R>0$, the integral over the space outside the sphere of radius $R$ is 0 . To show this, since $|\\Psi|$ is exponentially decaying, we only need to show that the integral over a spherical shell is 0 . To show this, we can show that the integral of $\\mathbf{B}$ inside a sphere of radius $R$ is independent of $R$. Indeed, this quickly follows from dimensional analysis (the only relevant quantities are $\\mu_{0}, \\mu_{p}$, and $R$, and one can check that $\\mu_{0} \\mu_{p}$ already gives the right dimensions, and there is no dimensionless combination of these 3 quantities. In fact, we will actually compute this integral at the end.)\n\nNow, it suffices to compute the integral of $\\mathbf{B}|\\Psi|^{2}$ inside the sphere. Since $R$ was arbitrary, we can make it very small, much smaller than $a_{0}$. Then we can replace $|\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}$ with $|\\Psi(0)|^{2}=\\frac{1}{\\pi a_{0}^{3}}$, a constant that can be factored out. The problem reduces to computing the integral of $\\mathbf{B}$ inside a sphere of radius $R$.\n\nWe can compute this integral by splitting the sphere up into many thin discs, all perpendicular to the $z$ axis. We have to add up the $\\mathbf{B}$ field integrated over the volume of each disc, which is equivalent to the magnetic flux through the disc times the thickness of the disc. The magnetic flux through each disc can be calculated using the mutual inductance reciprocity theorem. Suppose a current $I$ goes around the boundary of the disc (a ring) with radius $r$. Then the mutual inductance $M$ between the ring and the dipole is given by the flux through the dipole divided by $I$ :\n\n$$\nM=\\frac{B * A}{I}\n$$\n\nwhere $B$ is the magnetic field produced by the ring's current at the dipole's position, and $A$ is the area of the dipole. The dipole itself carries current $i=\\frac{\\mu_{p}}{A}$, so the flux through the ring is given by\n\n$$\n\\Phi=M * i=\\frac{B i A}{I}=\\frac{\\mu_{p} B}{I}\n$$\n\nwhere $B=\\frac{\\mu_{0} I}{4 \\pi} * \\frac{2 \\pi r^{2}}{\\left(r^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} I r^{2}}{2\\left(r^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$, where $z$ is the $z$ coordinate of the ring.

Assume the two\n\nlenses are $10 \\mathrm{~cm}$ apart and such a cuboid of volume $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ is placed such that its right face is $2 \\mathrm{~cm}$ to the left of the left lens. What's the maximum possible volume of the intermediate image (i.e., image formed by just the left lens) of the cuboid? Answer in $\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.",
        "solution": [
            "First, note that the two lenses share a focal point. Here's why. For any cuboid with four edges parallel to the optical axis, consider the four parallel rays of light that these four edges lie on. The intermediate images formed by the left lens of these four edges lie on these same light rays after they've passed through the left lens, and the final images of the edges (images formed by the right lens of the intermediate images) lie on these same light rays after they've also passed through the right lens. Since the initial rays were parallel and the same goes for the final rays, the intermediate rays intersect at a focal point of both the left lens and the right lens at the same time.\n\nNow, let $f, f^{\\prime}$ be the focal lengths of the left and right lenses, respectively. Although they can be any nonzero real number, we will WLOG assume that they are positive. (The following derivation will still hold with either $f$ or $f^{\\prime}$ negative, as long as we have the right sign conventions for all the variables.)\n\nFor a point at a distance $x_{1}$ to the left of $F$, its image is at a distance $x_{2}^{\\prime}=-\\left(\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f}\\right)^{2} x_{1}$ to the right of $F^{\\prime}$. This follows from applying Newton's formula twice:\n\n$$\nx_{2}^{\\prime}=\\frac{f^{\\prime 2}}{x_{1}^{\\prime}}=-\\frac{f^{\\prime 2}}{x_{2}}=-\\frac{f^{\\prime 2}}{f^{2}} x_{1}\n$$\n\nThus, the optical system magnifies horizontal distances by $\\left(\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f}\\right)^{2}$.\n\nOn the other hand, for a point at height $h_{1}$ (relative to the optical axis), consider a horizontal light ray through the point. Then the final light ray (after it passes through both lenses) is at a height of\n\n$$\nh_{2}=-\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f} h_{1}\n$$\n\nwhich is the height of the final image of the point. Hence, the optical system magnifies transverse distances (i.e., distances perpendicular to the optical axis) by $\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f}$.\n\nThe two results above imply that volumes are magnified by\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f}\\right)^{4}\n$$\n\n(The second factor is squared because there are two transverse dimensions.) Given that volumes are magnified by 500 times, we obtain $\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f}= \\pm 500^{1 / 4}$.\n\nWe now look at a cuboid with volume $V$ whose right face is at a distance $d$ to the left of $F$.

In the case of an ideal coin, it is well-established that each flip has an equal $50 \\%$ chance of landing as either heads or tails.\nHowever, coin flips are not entirely random. They appear random to us because we lack sufficient information about the coin's initial conditions. If we possessed this information, we would always be able to predict the outcome without needing to flip the coin. For an intriguing discussion on why this observation is significant, watch this video by Vsauce.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where a coin with uniform density and negligible width is tossed directly upward from a height of $h=0.75 \\mathrm{~m}$ above the ground. The coin starts with its heads facing upward and is given an initial vertical velocity of $v_{y}=49 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ and a positive angular velocity of $\\omega=\\pi \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$. What face does the coin display upon hitting the ground? Submit $\\mathbf{0}$ for heads and $\\mathbf{1}$ for tails. You only have one attempt for this problem.

Here is a solution written by one of our contestants\n\n\n\nGuangyuan Chen. The circuit continuously delivers sinusoidal power to the lightbulb. In order to maintain a quasi-equilibrium state, there must be some form of heat loss present in the system. We will assume that the main source of heat loss is through radiation, though we will see that the precise form of heat loss is largely inconsequential.\n\nLet the power delivered by the circuit be in the form $P_{d}=P_{0} \\sin ^{2} \\Omega t$.

The recurrence relation from the relativistic velocity addition formula is: $u_{k+1}=\\frac{u_{k}(k+3)+(k+1)}{u_{k}(k+1)+(k+3)}$, starting with $u_{1}=\\frac{1}{3}$. The relation can be simplified as: $u_{k+1}=1+\\frac{2\\left(u_{k}-1\\right)}{u_{k}(k+1)+(k+3)}$. Introducing $v_{k}=u_{k}-1$, $v_{k+1}=v_{k} \\frac{2}{v_{k}(k+1)+(2 k+4)}$. Further simplifying with $w_{k}=\\frac{1}{v_{k}}$, we get $w_{k+1}=w_{k}(k+2)+\\frac{k+1}{2}$. By setting $x_{k}=w_{k}+c$, we find $c=-\\frac{1}{2}$ simplifies to $x_{k+1}=x_{k}(k+2)$. This gives $x_{k}=$ $(k+1)(k)(k-1) \\ldots(4)(3) x_{1}$ and using the initial condition $x_{1}=\\frac{1}{u_{1}-1}+\\frac{1}{2}=1$, we obtain $x_{k}=\\frac{(k+1) !}{2}$.

Let $u_{m}=\\frac{m-1}{m+1}$. Then you can find that the velocity addition of any $l, m$ will be $\\frac{m l-1}{m l+1}$. Using this identity, we can use recurrence to find that $u_{k}=\\frac{(k+1) !-1}{(k+1) !+1}$."

        "solution": [
            "Note that the proper treatment of this problem requires more advanced electromagnetism. The following might seem sketchy, but this will do. We first consider the case of a thin plane made of an ideal conductor placed at $z=0$. A monochromatic electromagnetic wave with an $E$ field: $\\vec{E}_{i}(t, z)=E_{0} \\cos (k z-\\omega t) \\hat{x}$ is incident on the plane. The corresponding $B$ field is of course $\\vec{B}_{i}(t, z)=\\frac{E_{0}}{c} \\cos (k z-\\omega t) \\hat{y}$. We expect a current density $\\hat{K}(t)=K(t) \\hat{x}$ to form in the direction of the $E$ field, as the electric field accelerates the charges on the sheet $-K(t)$ will oscillate with the $E$ field. We know that perfect conductors completely reflect electromagnetic waves, so we expect no EM field in the $z>0$ region. The total EM field is a combination of the incident wave and the wave generated by the oscillating surface charges, so we are to believe that the latter provides just the right EM wave to cancel out $\\vec{B}_{i}$ and $\\vec{E}_{i}$ in the $z>0$ region. Consider an instance where the EM waves have an orientation shown in the figure below. It's easy to verify that the magnetic field generated by a uniform sheet of current pointing out of the page is given as shown. Since the electric wave generated by $\\vec{K}(t)$ must cancel the $\\vec{E}_{i}$ pointing out of page in $z>0$, we get a poynting vector (for the wave generated by $\\vec{K}$ ) in the $\\hat{z}$ direction in $z>0$. By symmetry, this means that the poynting vector points in the $-\\hat{z}$ direction in $z<0$. Such simple symmetry arguments fully determine the wave generated by an oscillating sheet of charge: $\\left|\\vec{E}_{k}(t, z)\\right|=\\left|\\vec{E}_{i}(t, z)\\right|$, $\\left|\\vec{B}_{k}(t, z)\\right|=\\left|\\vec{B}_{i}(t, z)\\right|$ with the orientations shown below.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_2b2b8ef412b21d2cd384g-1.jpg?height=515&width=1485&top_left_y=1317&top_left_x=323)\n\nWe therefore get that the total magnetic field in the $z<0$ region is $\\vec{B}=2 \\vec{B}_{i}(t, z)$. Let us now take an Ampere loop as shown in the figure below:\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_2b2b8ef412b21d2cd384g-1.jpg?height=431&width=913&top_left_y=2040&top_left_x=606)\n\n\n\nWe have:\n$$\nT_{\\epsilon} \\equiv \\oint_{\\Gamma_{\\epsilon}} \\vec{B}(t,-\\epsilon / 2) \\cdot d \\vec{l}=\\mu_{0} I_{e n c}+\\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{S_{\\epsilon}} \\vec{E}(t, z) \\cdot d \\vec{A}\n$$\nwhere $S_{\\epsilon}$ is the surface bounded by $\\Gamma_{\\epsilon}$. Since $\\vec{E}=0$ everywhere and $I_{e n c}=K(t) l$,\n$$\n\\lim _{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} T_{\\epsilon}=\\frac{2 E_{0} l}{c} \\cos (\\omega t)=\\mu_{0} K(t) l\n$$\nHence, we have $\\vec{K}(t)=\\frac{2 E_{0}}{\\mu_{0} c} \\cos (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$. The key find in this long introduction is that an oscillating sheet of current $\\vec{K}(t)=K_{0} \\cos (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$ generates an EM wave with an electric field $\\vec{E}_{K}(t, 0)=-\\frac{\\mu_{0} c}{2} \\vec{K}(t)$ near the sheet (at $z=0$ ). We finally return to the original problem.\n\nAll laser beams have poynting vectors pointing radially outwards, so the $E_{i}$ field must point in the tangential direction to the sphere at all normal incidence. Say the $E_{i}$ field points in the $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction, so that the current in the shell flows from the north pole to the south pole. The condition $\\delta \\ll \\frac{c}{f_{0}} \\ll R$ allows us to neglect attenuation due to skin effects - essentially, the electric field, thus the surface current, is approximately uniform in the shell. The condition $\\frac{c}{f_{0}} \\ll R$ allows us to treat the incidence of the laser beams as an EM wave hitting an Ohmic plane of thickness $\\delta$, so we consider that problem first. Denote the total electric field inside the the plane at time $t$ as $\\vec{E}(t)$. The current density is given by Ohm's law: $\\vec{J}(t)=\\vec{E}(t) / \\rho$. The corresponding surface current is of course $\\vec{K}(t)=\\delta \\vec{E} / \\rho(t)$. Carefully note the distinction between $\\vec{E}$ and $\\vec{E}_{i}$. Since the source wave $\\vec{E}_{i}(t)$ is sinusoidal, we expect $\\vec{E}(t)$ to be sinusoidal as well so that $\\vec{E}_{K}(t)=-\\frac{\\mu_{0} c}{2} \\vec{K}(t)$ applies. The total electric field inside the sheet is a sum of $\\vec{E}_{K}$ and $\\vec{E}_{i}$, thus:\n$$\n\\vec{E}(t)=\\vec{E}_{i}(t)-\\frac{\\mu_{0} c \\delta}{2 \\rho} \\vec{E}(t)\n$$\nRearranging for $\\vec{E}(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\vec{E}(t)=\\frac{\\vec{E}_{i}(t)}{1+\\mu_{0} c \\delta / 2 \\rho}\n$$\nOn the sphere, $\\vec{E}(t)$ points in the $\\hat{\\theta}$ direction and has the same magnitude everywhere on the sphere. The relevant cross-section will be the lateral surface of a truncated cone, as shown below:\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_6c662ae0f0d7d28d415dg-1.jpg?height=589&width=597&top_left_y=1798&top_left_x=756)\n\n\n\nThe current through this surface is therefore:\n$$\nI(\\theta, t)=\\frac{\\pi \\delta(2 R+\\delta)\\left|\\vec{E}_{i}(t)\\right|}{\\rho+\\mu_{0} c \\delta / 2} \\sin \\theta\n$$\nThe power dissipated by a volume generated by $\\theta \\sim \\theta+d \\theta$ is\n$$\nd P(t)=I^{2}(\\theta, t) \\frac{\\rho(R+\\delta / 2) d \\theta}{\\pi \\delta(2 R+\\delta) \\sin \\theta}\n$$\nWe integrate this expression from $\\theta=0$ to $\\theta=\\pi$ :\n$$\nP(t)=\\frac{\\pi \\delta \\rho(2 R+\\delta)^{2}}{\\left(\\rho+\\mu_{0} c \\delta / 2\\right)^{2}}\\left|\\vec{E}_{i}(t)\\right|^{2}\n$$\nNow, the incident electric field has the form $\\left|\\vec{E}_{i}(t)\\right|^{2}=\\frac{2 I_{0}}{\\epsilon_{0} c} \\cos ^{2}\\left(2 \\pi f_{0} t\\right)$. The average of this function from $t=0$ to $t=\\frac{1}{f_{0}}$ is $1 / 2$, so our final answer is:\n$$\n\\bar{P}=\\frac{\\pi \\delta \\rho(2 R+\\delta)^{2}}{\\left(\\rho+\\mu_{0} c \\delta / 2\\right)^{2}} \\frac{I_{0}}{\\epsilon_{0} c}\n$$\nwhich turns out to be $2.39078 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~W}$"

Neglect the possibility of electrical discharge throughout the next two problems.\nFollin then gives the ball a charge $0.15 \\mathrm{nC}$. Assuming that the charge is distributed evenly across the surface of the ball, find the subsequent horizontal deflection of the pendulum bob's center of mass from its hanging point at equilibrium.",

This force can be neglected because it is much smaller than $\\frac{Q V}{d}$ (an assumption that will be justified at the end of the solution). The mass of the string, however, needs to be considered. Consider the forces on an infinitesimal segment of the string. The horizontal component of the tension must balance out the electric force on the ball and the vertical component must balance out the weight of everything below it (string and ball). This gives us\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d h}=\\frac{F}{m g+\\lambda g h}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the height above the ball, $x$ is the horizontal displacement from equilibrium, $F$ is the electrostatic force, $\\lambda$ is the mass density of the string, and $m$ is the mass of the ball.

Using the method of image charges, the force due to the closer plate is equivalent to a charge $-Q$ a distance of $d-2 x$ away.

Identifying particle processes \n\nNote: all numerical values in this problem are given in natural units: $c=1$, mass measured in $\\mathrm{GeV}=1$, so no unit conversions are necessary, even when dimensions don't seem to align (this allows us to do things like sum momentum and energy without worrying about units).\n\nThe 4-momentum of a relativistic particle is the 4-dimensional vector\n\n$$\n\\vec{P}=\\left(E, p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhere $E$ is the particle's energy and $\\left(p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z}\\right)$ is the standard 3-momentum (excluding the time component). The total (summed) 4-momentum of a system is always conserved. The components of 4-momentum can be related to the rest mass $m$ of the particle by\n\n$$\nE^{2}=m^{2}+p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+p_{z}^{2} .\n$$\n\nA particle accelerator records the 4-momenta of 2 muon-antimuon pairs produced by some particle processes. Other particles produced by the processes are not measured by the detector. Below are two possible processes that involve muon-antimuon production and down quark-antiquark production. We know that out of the two measured 4-momentum pairs, one corresponds to Process A and the other to Process B. Using the muon-antimuon 4-momenta given below, determine which corresponds to each process. The numbers will be truncated for simplicity and slightly fudged from precise values to account for some small error in the measurement, so don't expect precision for small values (this should not affect the problem). The points will be given for an explanation of how you reached your conclusion; simply guessing the process correctly will result in at most one point. Also note that both processes are valid, you do not need to verify that they could actually happen. A table of (mean) particle rest masses may prove useful:\n\n| Particle | Rest Mass |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| Higgs | $\\sim 125$ |\n| Z | $\\sim 91$ |\n| Top | $\\sim 172$ |\n| Bottom | $\\sim 4.2$ |\n| Up | $\\sim 0.0024$ |\n| Muon | $\\sim 0.1$ |\n| Neutrino | $\\sim 0$ |\n\nProcess A: The collision of an up quark-antiquark pair results in the production of one Higgs boson and one $\\mathrm{Z}$ boson. The $\\mathrm{Z}$ boson then decays into a muon-antimuon pair\n\nProcess B: The collision of an up quark-antiquark pair results in the production of a top quark-antiquark pair. The top quark decays into a $\\mathrm{W}+$ boson and a bottom quark, while the anti-top decays into a W- boson and an anti-bottom quark. The W- then decays into a muon and an anti-neutrino, while the $\\mathrm{W}+$ decays into an anti-muon and neutrino.\n\nDetected muon-antimuon 4-momenta:\n\nх) $(149.0,12.6,-8.8,148.2) ;(163.7,-38.8,67.3,144.1)$\n\nу) $(319.5,-41.3,-24.2,315.8) ;(305.3,-60.1,25.0,298.1)$",

Given a rocket of mass $m_{0}$ and mass ejection rate $\\mu$, what ejection speed $u$ would be required to launch satellites in the Earth's gravitational field, of strength $g$ ? (An estimate, ignoring numerical factors, is acceptable.) What about launching space probes to other planets or out of the solar system? Can you guess why most rockets are multistage?",
        "solution": [
            "There are multiple ways of thinking about this problem.\n\n- (Easiest possible answer) To launch the rocket from earth we need at least the force from repulsion to be stronger than the gravity. That is $a=\\mu u / m_{0}>g$. (We get rid of numerical factors on the total mass.)\n\n\n\n- A nicer perspective: The rocket needs to get to gain enough mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential energy) from the repulsion process. It is known (from multiple ways) that the energy of an object with mass $m_{0}$ orbiting a planet in a orbit whose length of the semimajor axis is $a$ is $-G M m_{0} / 2 a=-g R^{2} m_{0} / 2 a$, where $R$ is the radius of the planet ( $G M$ the standard gravitational parameter). Therefore, the minimum energy is at $a=R$ ( $a$ cannot be lower), which is $-g R m_{0} / 2$. Besides that, we know that before launching, when the rocket is on the ground, its potential energy (kinetic energy being zero) is $-G M m_{0} / R=-g R m_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum mechanical energy needed is $g R m_{0} / 2$. This situation corresponds to \"launching\" the rocket horizontally. The rocket does not go high into the sky but flies right above the ground. As a result, as a not so bad approximation, the launching process is not affected much by the gravity. The kinetic energy of the rocket after its fuel used up, $m_{0} v_{f}^{2} / 2$ should be greater than $g R m_{0} / 2$. Therefore, we get a result:\n\n$$\nv_{f}^{2}>g R\n\\tag{19}\n$$\n\nAny answer that gets rid of numerical factors like $u^{2} \\geq g R$ is acceptable. If a student remember the value of the first cosmic speed of the earth: $v_{o}=\\sqrt{g R}=7.9 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$, and states that $v_{f}$, or a multiple of $u$ (like $2.302 u$ we got above), should be greater than $v_{o}$ is also great.\n\n- For launching our rocket to other planets, we need to escape from the gravitational field of the earth. That is, the final mechanical energy of the rocket should be greater than zero:\n\n$$\nv_{f}^{2}>2 g R\n\\tag{20}\n$$\n\nIt is also great if a student remember that the escape speed of the each is $v_{e}=\\sqrt{2 g R}=11.2$ and states that a multiple of $u$ should be larger than $v_{e}$.\n\n- The reason why rockets are multistage is that We see from previous parts that the ejection speed of the lightest fuel with $100 \\%$ energy conversion rate is only $u=5614 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, and the final speed $v_{f}$ of a very light rocket (mass ratio between fuel and rocket itself being 9 ) is just $\\approx 2.3 u=12.9 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$, which is only at the same magnitude of the first cosmic speed and the escape speed.\n\nIn real world, rockets cannot be so ideal. Therefore, a single stage rocket can hardly be launched to orbit around the earth, not to mention escaping. Multistage rockets drop part of its mass to further increase the mass ratio between the remaining fuel and itself in order to make itself to the sky."

It is natural to see waves in a lake but not something like the seiching, where the entire water volume oscillates, like the coffee in a cup that you carry to a waiting guest.\n\nIn order to create a model of the seiching we look at water in a rectangular container. The length of the container is $L$ and the depth of the water is $h$. Assume that the surface of the water to begin with makes a small angle with the horizontal. The seiching will then start, and we assume that the water surface continues to be plane but oscillates around an axis in the horizontal plane and located in the middle of the container.\n\nCreate a model of the movement of the water and derive a formula for the oscillation period $T$. The starting conditions are given in figure above.\n\nAssume that $\\xi<<h$. The table below shows experimental oscillation periods for different water depths in two containers of different lengths.

Then the charge on the capacitor of capacitance $C$ is found from the charge conservation law as\n\n$$\nq_{2}=q_{0}-q_{1} .\n\\tag{C3.3}\n$$\n\nAfter shortening the key the rate of current change in the coil of inductance $L$ is obtained as\n\n$$\n\\dot{I}_{1}=\\frac{q_{1}}{2 L C}\n\\tag{C3.4}\n$$\n\nwhereas in the coil of inductance $2 L$ it is equal to\n\n$$\n\\dot{I}_{2}=-\\frac{q_{0}-q_{1}}{2 L C}\n\\tag{C3.5}\n$$\n\nSince the voltage polarity on the capacitors are opposite, then the current derivative with respect to time finally takes the form\n\n$$\n\\dot{I}=\\dot{I}_{1}-\\dot{I}_{2}=\\frac{q_{0}}{2 L C}=\\omega^{2} q_{0}\n\\tag{C3.6}\n$$\n\nNote that this derivative is independent of the time of the key shortening!\n\nHence, the maximum current is found as\n\n$$\nI_{\\max }=\\frac{\\dot{I}}{\\omega}=\\omega q_{0}=\\frac{q_{0}}{\\sqrt{2 L C}}\n\\tag{C3.7}\n$$\n\nand it is independent of the time of the key shortening!"

This would be described by a fourth order algebraic equation and therefore, it is not realistic to accomplish such a solution within a reasonable time frame.\n\nNote that the interior of the building needs to lie inside the region where the targets can be hit with a stone thrown from the top with initial speed $v_{\\min }$. Indeed, if we can throw over the building, we can hit anything inside by lowering the throwing angle. On the other hand, the boundary of the targetable region needs to touch the building. Indeed, if there were a gap, it would be possible to hit a target just above the point where the optimal trajectory touches the building; the trajectory through that target wouldn't touch the building anywhere, hence we arrive at a contradiction.\n\nSo, with $v_{0}$ corresponding to the optimal trajectory, the targetable region touches the building; due to symmetry, overall there are two touching points (for smaller speeds, there would be four, and for larger speeds, there would be none). With the origin at the top of the building, the intersection points are defined by the following system of equations:\n\n$$\nx^{2}+z^{2}+2 z R=0, \\quad z=\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}-\\frac{g x^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\n$$\n\nUpon eliminating $z$, this becomes a biquadratic equation for $x$ :\n\n$$\nx^{4}\\left(\\frac{g}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{2}+x^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{4 g}+R\\right) \\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{g}=0\n$$\n\nHence the speed by which the real-valued solutions disappear can be found from the condition that the discriminant vanishes:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}=2\n$$\n\nBearing in mind that due to the energy conservation law, at the ground level the squared speed is increased by $4 g R$.

            "Let us analyse, what would be the change of the magnetic energy when one of the straws is displaced to a small distance. The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\pm \\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\n\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^{2} \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\n\n\n\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\Phi}{a^{2}}$. So, the energy density $w=\\frac{B^{2}}{2 \\mu_{0}}=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^{2} \\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\Phi^{2}}{a^{4}}$, hence\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\Phi^{2}}{a^{2}}\n$$\n\nFor the two straws, we have four magnetic charges.

        "solution": [
            "PART B\n\nAs the liquids are in thermal contact with each other, their temperatures increase in time in the same way.\n\nAt the beginning of the heating, what corresponds to the left sloped part of the diagram, no evaporation can occur. The free evaporation from the upper surface of the liquid B cannot occur - it is impossible due to the layer of the non-volatile liquid $\\mathrm{C}$. The evaporation from the inside of the system is considered below.\n\n\n\nLet us consider a bubble formed in the liquid $\\mathrm{A}$ or in the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$ or on the surface that separates these liquids. Such a bubble can be formed due to fluctuations or for many other reasons, which will not be analyzed here.\n\nThe bubble can get out of the system only when the pressure inside it equals to the external pressure $p_{0}$ (or when it is a little bit higher than $p_{0}$ ). Otherwise, the bubble will collapse.\n\nThe pressure inside the bubble formed in the volume of the liquid A or in the volume of the liquid B equals to the pressure of the saturated vapor of the liquid A or B, respectively. However, the pressure inside the bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids A and B is equal to the sum of the pressures of the saturated vapors of both these liquids, as then the bubble is in a contact with the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ at the same time. In the case considered the pressure inside the bubble is greater than the pressures of the saturated vapors of each of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ (at the same temperature).\n\nTherefore, when the system is heated, the pressure $p_{0}$ is reached first in the bubbles that were formed on the surface separating the liquids. Thus, the temperature $t_{1}$ corresponds to a kind of common boiling of both liquids that occurs in the region of their direct contact. The temperature $t_{1}$ is for sure lower than the boiling temperatures of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ as then the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are less then $p_{0}$ (their sum equals to $p_{0}$ and each of them is greater than zero).\n\nIn order to determine the value of $t_{1}$ with required accuracy, we can calculate the values of the sum of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B for several values of the temperature $t$ and look when one gets the value $p_{0}$.\n\nFrom the formula given in the text of the problem, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{p_{A}}{p_{0}}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{T}+\\beta_{A}}, \\\\\n& \\frac{p_{B}}{p_{0}}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{T}+\\beta_{B}} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$p_{A}+p_{B}$ equals to $p_{0}$ if\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{A}}{p_{0}}+\\frac{p_{B}}{p_{0}}=1\n$$\n\nThus, we have to calculate the values of the following function:\n\n$$\ny(x)=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{t+t_{0}}+\\beta_{A}}+e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{t+t_{0}}+\\beta_{B}}\n$$\n\n(where $t_{0}=273.15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and to determine the temperature $t=t_{1}$, at which $y(t)$ equals to 1 . When calculating the values of the function $y(t)$ we can divide the intervals of the temperatures $t$ by 2 (approximately) and look whether the results are greater or less than 1 .\n\nWe have:\n\n\n\nTable 1.2\n\n| $t$ | $y(t)$ |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $<1($ see Tab. 1.1$)$ |\n| $77^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $>1\\left(\\right.$ as $t_{1}$ is less than $\\left.t_{b A}\\right)$ |\n| $59^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.749<1$ |\n| $70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $1.113>1$ |\n| $66^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.966<1$ |\n| $67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $1.001>1$ |\n| $66.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.983<1$ |\n\nTherefore, $t_{1} \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (with required accuracy).\n\nNow we calculate the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $A$ and $B$ at the temperature $t_{1} \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, i.e. the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ in each bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids. From the equations (1) and (2), we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{A} \\approx 0.734 p_{0}, \\\\\n& p_{B} \\approx 0.267 p_{0}, \\\\\n& \\left(p_{A}+p_{B}=1.001 p_{0} \\approx p_{0}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese pressures depend only on the temperature and, therefore, they remain constant during the motion of the bubbles through the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$. The volume of the bubbles during this motion also cannot be changed without violation of the relation $p_{A}+p_{B}=p_{0}$. It follows from the above remarks that the mass ratio of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B in each bubble is the same. This conclusion remains valid as long as both liquids are in the system. After total evaporation of one of the liquids the temperature of the system will increase again (second sloped part of the diagram). Then, however, the mass of the system remains constant until the temperature reaches the value $t_{2}$ at which the boiling of the liquid (remained in the vessel) starts. Therefore, the temperature $t_{2}$ (the higher horizontal part of the diagram) corresponds to the boiling of the liquid remained in the vessel.\n\nThe mass ratio $m_{A} / m_{B}$ of the saturated vapors of the liquids $A$ and $B$ in each bubble leaving the system at the temperature $t_{1}$ is equal to the ratio of the densities of these vapors $\\rho_{A} / \\rho_{B}$. According to the assumption 2, stating that the vapors can be treated as ideal gases, the last ratio equals to the ratio of the products of the pressures of the saturated vapors by the molecular masses:\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{B}}=\\frac{\\rho_{A}}{\\rho_{B}}=\\frac{p_{A} \\mu_{A}}{p_{B} \\mu_{B}}=\\frac{p_{A}}{p_{B}} \\mu\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{B}} \\approx 22.0\n$$\n\nWe see that the liquid A evaporates 22 times faster than the liquid B. The evaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid A during the \"surface boiling\" at the temperature $t_{1}$ is associated with the\n\n\n\nevaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g} / 22 \\approx 4.5 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid B. Thus, at the time $\\tau_{1}$ the vessel contains 95.5 $\\mathrm{g}$ of the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$ (and no liquid $\\mathrm{A}$ ). The temperature $t_{2}$ is equal to the boiling temperature of the liquid $\\mathrm{B}: t_{2}=100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$."

            "PART A\n\nAt the beginning one should notice that the kinetic energy of the electron accelerated with the potential difference $U=511 \\mathrm{kV}$ equals to its rest energy $E_{0}$. Therefore, at least in the case of the electron, the laws of the classical physics cannot be applied. It is necessary to use relativistic laws.\n\nThe relativistic equation of motion of a particle with the charge $e$ in the magnetic field B has the following form:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d t} \\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{F}_{L}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{p}=m_{0} \\gamma \\mathbf{v}$ denotes the momentum of the particle (vector) and\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{L}=e \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\n\nis the Lorentz force (its value is $e v B$ and its direction is determined with the right hand rule). $m_{0}$ denotes the (rest) mass of the particle and $v$ denotes the velocity of the particle. The quantity $\\gamma$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\n$$\n\nThe Lorentz force $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$ is perpendicular to the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ of the particle and to its momentum $\\mathbf{p}=m_{0} \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$. Hence,\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{F}_{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}=0\n$$\n\nMultiplying the equation of motion by $\\mathbf{p}$ and making use of the hint given in the text of the problem, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{d t} p^{2}=0\n$$\n\n\n\nIt means that the value of the particle momentum (and the value of the velocity) is constant during the motion:\n\n$$\np=m_{0} v \\gamma=\\text { const; } \\quad v=\\text { const. }\n$$\n\nThe same result can be obtained without any formulae in the following way:\n\nThe Lorentz force $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$ is perpendicular to the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ (and to the momentum $p$ as $\\left.\\mathbf{p}=m_{0} \\mathcal{W}\\right)$ and, as a consequence, to the trajectory of the particle. Therefore, there is no force that could change the component of the momentum tangent to the trajectory. Thus, this component, whose value is equal to the length of $\\mathbf{p}$, should be constant: $\\mathbf{p}=$ const. (The same refers to the component of the velocity tangent to the trajectory as $\\mathbf{p}=m_{0} \\mathcal{W}$ ).\n\nLet $s$ denotes the path passed by the particle along the trajectory. From the definition of the velocity, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d s}{d t}=v\n$$\n\nUsing this formula, we can rewrite the equation of motion as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nv \\frac{d}{d s} \\mathbf{p}=\\frac{d s}{d t} \\frac{d}{d s} \\mathbf{p}=\\frac{d}{d t} \\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{F}_{L}, \\\\\n\\frac{d}{d s} \\mathbf{p}=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{L}}{v} .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nDividing this equation by $p$ and making use of the fact that $p=$ const, we obtain:\n\n$$\nv \\frac{d}{d s} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{p}=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{L}}{v p}\n$$\n\nand hence\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d s} \\mathbf{t}=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{L}}{v p}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{t}=\\mathbf{p} / p=\\mathbf{v} / v$ is the versor (unit vector) tangent to the trajectory. The above equation is exactly the same for both electrons and protons if and only if the vector quantity:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{L}}{v p}\n$$\n\nis the same in both cases.\n\nDenoting corresponding quantities for protons with the same symbols as for the electrons, but with primes, one gets that the condition, under which both electrons and protons can move along the same trajectory, is equivalent to the equality:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{L}}{v p}=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{L}^{\\prime}}{v^{\\prime} p^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nHowever, the Lorentz force is proportional to the value of the velocity of the particle, and the directions of any two vectors of the following three: $\\mathbf{t}$ (or $\\mathbf{v}$ ), $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{L}}, \\mathbf{B}$ determine the direction of the third of them (right hand rule). Therefore, the above condition can be written in the following form:\n\n$$\n\\frac{e \\mathbf{B}}{p}=\\frac{e^{\\prime} \\mathbf{B}^{\\prime}}{p^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\n\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}^{\\prime}=\\frac{e}{e^{\\prime}} \\frac{p^{\\prime}}{p} \\mathbf{B}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}}{p} \\mathbf{B}\n$$\n\nThis means that at any point the direction of the field $\\mathbf{B}$ should be conserved, its orientation should be changed into the opposite one, and the value of the field should be multiplied by the same factor $p^{\\prime} / p$. The magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is a vector sum of the magnetic fields of the coils that are arbitrarily distributed in the space. Therefore, each of this fields should be scaled with the same factor $-p^{\\prime} / p$. However, the magnetic field of any coil is proportional to the current flowing in it.

The resultant of these two forces is zero.\n\nRemember that the temperature of the air parcel $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$ is given by (7), in which we can assume approximately $G=\\Gamma$ at any altitude $z$ near $z=z_{0}$.\n\nNow, consider the stability of the air parcel equilibrium:\n\nSuppose that the air parcel is lifted into a higher position, at the altitude $z_{0}+d$ (with $d>0$ ), $\\quad T_{\\text {parcel }}\\left(z_{0}+d\\right)=T_{\\text {parcel }}\\left(z_{0}\\right)-\\Gamma d$ and $T\\left(z_{0}+d\\right)=T\\left(z_{0}\\right)-\\Lambda d$.\n\n- In the case the atmosphere has temperature lapse rate $\\Lambda>\\Gamma$, we have $T_{\\text {parcel }}\\left(z_{0}+d\\right)>T\\left(z_{0}+d\\right)$, then $\\rho<\\rho^{\\prime}$. The buoyant force is then larger than the air parcel weight, their resultant is oriented upward and tends to push the parcel away from the equilibrium position.\n\nConversely, if the air parcel is lowered to the altitude $z_{0}-d(d>0)$, $T_{\\text {parcel }}\\left(z_{0}-d\\right)<T\\left(z_{0}-d\\right)$ and then $\\rho>\\rho^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe buoyant force is then smaller than the air parcel weight; their resultant is oriented downward and tends to push the parcel away from the equilibrium position (see Figure 1)\n\nSo the equilibrium of the parcel is unstable, and we found that: An atmosphere with a temperature lapse rate $\\Lambda>\\Gamma$ is unstable.\n\n- In an atmosphere with temperature lapse rate $\\Lambda<\\Gamma$, if the air parcel is lifted to a higher position, at altitude $z_{0}+d$ (with $d>0$ ), $\\quad T_{\\text {parcel }}\\left(z_{0}+d\\right)<T\\left(z_{0}+d\\right)$, then\n\n\n\n$\\rho>\\rho^{\\prime}$.

For these $k$ values, we only have one unstable equilibrium at the top of the hemisphere due to the gravitational force being zero there.\n\n\n\nFor some large enough value of $k$, the spring force at $\\pi / 2$ exactly compensates for the gravitational force - this marks the end of the first regime. In this next regime, we still have an unstable equilibrium at the top of the hemisphere - because the spring force only compensates for the gravitational force for larger $\\theta$. Additionally, we have two equilibria at $0<\\left|\\theta^{\\star}\\right|<\\pi / 2$. These equilibria must be stable because for $\\theta<\\theta^{\\star}$, the gravitational force is stronger than the spring force and forces the mass toward $\\theta^{\\star}$, whereas the opposite holds for $\\theta>\\theta^{\\star}$, and the mass is again forced toward $\\theta^{\\star}$. Thus, we have three total equilibria (two stable, one unstable).\n\n\n\nFinally, for sufficiently large $k$ the spring force is stronger than the gravitational force even for arbitrarily small $\\theta$, and so we have just one stable equilibrium point at the top of the hemisphere in this third regime.\n\n\n\nWe now compute the two critical points for us to fill out the table.

This kind of situation, where the overall setup is still symmetric but the individual equilibrium points are not, is called spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the problem, suppose the value of $k$ is such that the mass begins at stable equilibrium on the surface of the hemisphere at angle $\\theta_{0}$.

Consider decomposing the total force on the mass into radial and tangential parts. The radial part simply keeps the mass on the hemisphere; in the absence of a tangential force, the mass would travel in a great circle of radius $R$. Adding a tangential force deflects the mass away from this great circle trajectory, but doesn't change the radial force required, so the net radial force always has to be $m v^{2} / R$ inward.\n\n\n\nNote: The phrase \"total radial force\" could also validly be interpreted as the net radial force.

For example, one can run a Carnot cycle between the first two objects until they are at the same temperature, then run a Carnot cycle in reverse between the last two objects using the stored work. At this point, the first two objects will no longer be at the same temperature, so we can repeat the procedure; this yields an infinite series for $T_{H}$. Some students did this, and took only the first term of the series. This yields a fairly good approximation of $T_{H} \\approx 395 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\n\n\nAnother explicit method is to continuously switch between running one Carnot engine forward and another Carnot engine in reverse; this yields three differential equations for $T_{1}, T_{2}$, and $T_{3}$.

        "solution": [
            "First we'll look for the height $H$ at which we should push to topple the domino with the least momentum. A convenient method is to look at the angular momentum in the domino because this is easy to calculate and describes rotational motion. Because the push is horizontal, the moment arm of the push (about the domino's rotational axis) is purely vertical. That means the angular momentum of the push is $p H$, where $p$ is the momentum imparted and $H$ is the height of the push. There is some minimum angular momentum $L_{\\min }$ to topple the domino, so we set $L_{\\min }=p H$. The bigger $H$, the smaller $p$, so we should choose the largest possible $H$. In other words, we should push at the very top of the domino, $H=h$. While we're on this part, note that if the push weren't constrained to be horizontal, the push could be a little bit smaller since the moment arm could be the entire diagonal of the thin edge of the domino.\n\n\n\nNext we calculate the minimum $p$ using energy. As the domino rotates, it converts kinetic energy to potential energy, so we'll calculate both. The domino's potential energy is greatest when its center of mass is directly over the contact point of the domino and the table. That height is half the diagonal of the domino, so the distance from the contact point to the center of the domino is $\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{t^{2}+h^{2}}$. From the push until it reaches this point, the domino's potential energy increases by\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\Delta U=\\frac{1}{2} m g\\left(\\sqrt{t^{2}+h^{2}}-h\\right)\n\n$$\n\n\n\nThen the domino topples. By conservation of energy, $\\Delta U$ is how much rotational kinetic energy the domino must have begun with.\n\n\n\nNext we find the kinetic energy using the rotational kinetic energy formula, $T=L^{2} / 2 I$. The moment of inertia of the domino about its contact point with the table is $I=\\frac{1}{3} m\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find this with an integral, or if you know the moment of inertia about the center $\\left(\\frac{1}{12} m\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)\\right.$ ), you can use the parallel axis theorem. We know the momentum $L=p h$, so the kinetic energy is\n\n\n\n$$\n\nT=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{L^{2}}{I}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(p h)^{2}}{(1 / 3) m\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)}=\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{p^{2} h^{2}}{m\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nSetting the initial kinetic energy equal to the gain in potential energy and solving for $p$,\n\n\n\n$$\n\np_{\\min }=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\frac{m}{h} \\sqrt{g\\left(\\sqrt{t^{2}+h^{2}}-h\\right)\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)}\n\n$$"

When a domino topples, it collides with the next domino in the row. Imagine this collision to be completely inelastic. What fraction of the total kinetic energy is lost in the collision of the first domino with the second domino?",
        "solution": [
            "Right after the collision, the dominoes touch at a height $\\sqrt{h^{2}-l^{2}}$ above the table. The second domino is vertical, while the first is rotated so that the angle between its leading edge and the table is $\\theta=\\arccos (l / h)$. Let the dominoes' angular velocities be $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ respectively. After the dominoes collide, they stick together. If we take the two parts of the dominoes that are in contact, they must have the same horizontal velocity component in order for the dominoes to stay in contact. For the first domino, this velocity is $\\omega_{1} h \\sin \\theta=\\omega_{1} \\sqrt{h^{2}-l^{2}}$. For the second domino it is $\\omega_{2}$ times the height of the impact point, so $\\omega_{2} \\sqrt{h^{2}-l^{2}}$. Because these velocity components must be equal, $\\omega_{1}=\\omega_{2}$.\n\n\n\nThis means the dominoes have the same angular momentum as each other, measured relative to their respective rotation axes. If we look at the collision, the forces between the dominoes are purely horizontal because the dominoes' faces are frictionless, so they only exert normal forces. The second domino is vertical, so all its normal forces are purely horizontal. These horizontal normal forces exchange angular momentum between the two dominoes. They have the same moment arm (i.e. the height of the collision), so the amount of angular momentum transferred out of the first domino is equal to the amount gained by the second domino, both measured relative to the dominoes' respective rotation axes. Because the dominoes are identical and have the same angular velocity, they have the same angular momentum. This means each domino has half as much angular momentum about its rotation axis as the first domino had just before the collision. (Note that forces from the table cannot change the angular momentum of the dominoes about their respective rotational axes because such forces have zero moment arm, so only the inter-domino forces need to be examined here.)\n\n\n\nKinetic energy scales with the square of angular momentum, so each domino has a quarter as much kinetic energy after the collision as the first domino had before it. That means the total kinetic energy after the collision is half what it was before the collision. The fraction of kinetic energy lost is one half."

Also, let's call the angle a domino rotates from its standing position up to its point of highest potential energy $\\phi$, so the dominoes have rotated $\\phi+\\alpha$ and $\\phi+\\beta$ respectively.\n\n\n\nThe dominoes need to be in contact. The top right corner of the first domino has moved horizontally a distance $h \\sin (\\phi+\\alpha)$ which we will approximate as $h(\\phi+\\alpha)$ using the small angle approximation. The top left corner of the second domino moves horizontally forward by $h \\sin (\\phi+\\beta)+t(1-\\cos (\\phi+\\beta))$. We ignore the cosine term as second order in the rotation angle and approximate this as $h(\\phi+\\beta)$.\n\n\n\nThe $y$-coordinate of the upper right corner of the first domino is $h(1-\\cos (\\phi+\\alpha)) \\approx h$. The $y$-coordinate of the upper left corner of the second domino is $h(1-\\cos (\\phi+\\beta))+t \\sin (\\phi+\\beta) \\approx$ $h+t(\\phi+\\beta)$ There is a first-order difference in $y$-coordinates of the two corners, but this means the difference in $x$ coordinate between the top left corner of the second domino and the top right corner of the first domino is second-order in the rotation angles.

These figures come from fitting a quadratic whose peak is when the center of mass is above the rotation point and which is zero when the domino is upright.

            "The motion of the rod can be decomposed as a superposition of rotation about the center of mass, and translation of the center of mass. We claim that the bead is stationary at this moment. To see this, note that the bead cannot have a vertical velocity component since it is fixed to the rod. Moreover, it cannot have a horizontal velocity component, because since the system experiences no external forces in the horizontal direction, the motion of the center of mass has no horizontal component.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the bead is stationary, and since the released gravitational potential energy is $M g R$, the speed $v$ of the ball obeys\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{2} M v^{2}=M g R \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v=\\sqrt{2 g R}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nThe motion of the system consists of a downward speed $v / 2$ of the center of mass, superposed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\non a rotation about the center of mass which gives the masses speed $v / 2$.\n\n\n\nNow consider the forces on the ball. The only horizontal force on the ball is the force in the rod, so we need to find the horizontal acceleration of the ball. Part of this is due to the centripetal force associated with the rotational motion,\n\n\n\n$$\n\nF=\\frac{M(v / 2)^{2}}{R / 2}=M g\n\n$$\n\n\n\nAnother part of the ball's acceleration is due to the acceleration of the center of mass, but this is purely vertical and hence irrelevant here. A third part is due to the angular acceleration about the center of mass, but this also is associated with a vertical acceleration of the ball and hence irrelevant. Thus the force in the rod is just a tension\n\n\n\n$$\n\nT=M g\n\n$$\n\n\n\nA common pitfall to think of the motion of the system as pure rotation about the bead, giving the incorrect answer $F=M v^{2} / R=2 M g$. The reason this is incorrect is that, while it correctly describes the instantaneous velocity, to compute the acceleration one must also account for the rate of change of the pivot point. It can be easy to miss this, because the point at which the pivot is currently located (the bead, in this case) always has zero instantaneous velocity. Yet the pivot point itself does have an instantaneous velocity, which must be accounted for. It is possible to solve the problem this way, but it's subtle.",

Plugging in the result from either part (c) below or the first solution above gives $a_{x}=-g$, which indicates a force of $M g$ to the left, and hence a tension in the rod. Incidentally, yet another solution is to use $F=M v^{2} / R$ where $R$ is the instantaneous radius of curvature of the ellipse, which may be computed directly.",

Since the small piece of thread is in equilibrium, the $x$-component of the tension is the same everywhere:\n\n$$\nT_{x}=\\text { const. }\n$$\n\nThe normal force $\\Delta N$ can be determined by looking at the top view of the loop in Fig. 1. The polar angle corresponding to small piece of thread is $\\Delta \\varphi=\\Delta x / R$, so the force balance in the radial direction can be written as\n\n$$\n2 T_{x} \\underbrace{\\sin \\frac{\\Delta \\varphi}{2}}_{\\approx \\Delta \\varphi / 2}-\\Delta N=0 \\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad \\Delta N=T_{x} \\frac{\\Delta x}{R} .\n\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nThe frictional force on the verge of slipping is given by\n\n$$\n\\Delta f=\\mu \\Delta N\n\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nThus, the force balance on the small piece of thread in the $z$ direction (see Fig. 2):\n\n$$\n\\left.T_{x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} z}{\\mathrm{~d} x}\\right|_{x+\\Delta x}-\\left.T_{x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} z}{\\mathrm{~d} x}\\right|_{x}-\\Delta f=0\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhere we expressed the $z$-component of the tension forces with $T_{x}$ and the tangent $\\mathrm{d} z / \\mathrm{d} x$.

In the limit $\\mu \\rightarrow 0$ the loop slips even if $L=2 \\pi R$, which should be reproduced by our final formula.

        "question": "a. Find the force $F_{1}$ acting on the solenoid when its head $O_{1}$ is positioned in the loop centre $O$. What is the force $F_{2}$ acting on the solenoid when its tail $O_{2}$ is located in the centre of the loop?",
        "solution": [
            "According to Newton's third law, the force acting on the solenoid is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the force acting on the loop. The latter can be obtained from Lorentz's law by summation of infinitesimal forces $\\vec{F}=J \\Delta \\vec{l} \\times \\vec{B}$ acting on the individual loop elements $\\Delta \\vec{l}$, where $J=\\mathcal{E} / R$ is the current in the loop.\n\nSince the solenoid is long and thin, the magnetic field lines inside it are directed in $+z$ direction, and escape only from the immediate vicinity of its ends. The magnetic field outside the solenoid is vortex-free and sourcefree. The same requirements are satisfied by the electric field in empty space. Hence, the magnetic field outside the solenoid can be well approximated by a field created by two magnetic poles: a North pole residing close to point $O_{1}$ and a South pole located near to $O_{2}$. The flux $\\Phi$ emerging from the North pole (and the flux entering the South pole) is the same as the flux passing through the solenoid's cross-section:\n\n$$\n\\Phi=B_{\\text {in }} A=\\mu_{0} \\frac{N I}{\\ell} A\n$$\n\nWhen the endpoint $O_{1}$ of the solenoid is placed in the loop centre $O$, the magnetic field of the other end $\\left(O_{2}\\right)$ near the loop is negligible. The field created by the North pole located at $O_{1}$ is pointing radially outwards, and its magnitude at the loop circumference is (from spherical symmetry):\n\n$$\nB(r)=\\frac{\\Phi}{4 \\pi r^{2}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{N I A}{\\ell r^{2}}\n$$\n\nNote. it is also correct to assume that the flux from the $B$-field (which carries a factor of $1 / 2$ compared to the field above at the end of the solenoid is uniformly distributed over hemisphere.\n\nThe forces acting on all elements of the loop (and also the net force) point in the $-z$ direction, which can be expected also from the same current directions (i.e. the loop and the solenoid attract each other). Hence, the reaction force acting on the solenoid points in the $+z$ direction, and its magnitude is given by:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R} \\cdot 2 \\pi r \\cdot \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{N I A}{\\ell r^{2}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} N I A \\mathcal{E}}{2 \\ell R r} .\n$$\n\nWhen the endpoint $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is located at the centre of the loop, the magnetic field produced by the South pole exerts a force on the loop. Since this field is directed radially inward, the force acting on the solenoid is the same in magnitude, but opposite in direction $(-z)$ as the force calculated above:\n\n$$\nF_2 = -F_1\n$$",
            "In this solution the force acting on the solenoid is calculated, as the force acting on the magnetic pole placed at the centre of the current-carrying loop. For this we need to find an expression for the magnetic pole strength (or magnetic charge) $Q_{\\mathrm{m}}$, which is defined as the ratio of the force and the magnetic field.\n\nThe total dipole moment $m$ of the solenoid is the product of the number of turns and the dipole moment $I A$ of each turn:\n\n$$\nm=N I A .\n$$\n\nThis can be also expressed with the magnetic pole strength and the distance of the poles: $m=Q_{\\mathrm{m}} \\ell$. From this we arrive to the expression\n\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{N I A}{\\ell}=\\frac{\\Phi}{\\mu_{0}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the total flux emerging from the pole (see solution I).\n\nNote. The same result can be obtained from the analogy between electrostatic and magnetostatic fields. The Coulomb force between two point charges $\\pm Q$ can be derived from the principle of virtual work. The force is the derivative of the interaction part of the field energy with respect to the distance between the charges. The force between two magnetic charges $\\pm Q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ can be also calculated this way. From the expressions of electric and magnetic energy densities we can conclude the formula of the magnetic interaction force:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nw_{E}=\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{0} E^{2} \\quad \\longleftrightarrow w_{B}=\\frac{1}{2 \\mu_{0}} B^{2}, \\\\\nF_{E}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{r^{2}} \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad F_{B}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{m}}^{2}}{r^{2}} .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nAs it can be seen, the well-known formulae known in electrostatics can be also used in magnetostatics with the substitutions $\\varepsilon_{0}^{-1} \\longleftrightarrow \\mu_{0}, E \\longleftrightarrow B, Q \\longleftrightarrow Q_{\\mathrm{m}}$. Carrying on this analogy the magnetic pole strength can be figured out:\n\n$$\nQ=\\varepsilon_{0} \\Psi \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad Q_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{\\Phi}{\\mu_{0}}=\\frac{N}{\\ell} I A\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Psi$ and $\\Phi$ are the electric and magnetic flux for a closed surface containing the electric and magnetic charge, respectively.\n\nWhen endpoint $O_{1}$ of the solenoid is located at point $O$, a North pole resides at the centre of the loop. Here the magnetic field created by the loop can be expressed from Biot-Savart-law:\n\n$$\nB_{\\text {loop }}^{(\\text {at center })}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} J}{2 r}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E}}{2 R r},\n$$\n\n\n\npointing in the $+z$ direction. So the magnitude of the force acting on this end of the solenoid is:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=Q_{\\mathrm{m}} B_{\\text {loop }}^{(\\text {at center })}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} N I A}{2 \\ell R r}\n$$\n\nand it is directed to $+z$. When the endpoint $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is located at the center of the loop, the force acting on the South pole should be calculated, resulting a force of same magnitude, but opposite direction.",
            "Some of the magnetic field lines created by the loop enter into the near end $O_{1}$ of the solenoid; this entering flux is given by\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\text {in }}=B_{\\text {loop }}^{\\text {(at center) }} A=\\frac{\\mu_{0} J}{2 r} A=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} A}{2 R r} .\n$$\n\nSince the end $O_{2}$ is far from the loop, the flux created by the loop escaping there is negligibly small. This means that almost all the flux $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ escapes from the solenoid through its side.\n\nDenote the radial component of the magnetic field vector produced by the current-carrying loop at the perimeter of the $i$ th turn of the solenoid by $B_{i}$. Only this component contributes to the net force acting on the solenoid, as the axial component produces a radial force which is cancelled due to rotational symmetry. The axial force acting on the $i$ th turn of the solenoid is given by\n\n$$\nF_{1, i}=2 \\sqrt{A \\pi} I B_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $2 \\sqrt{A \\pi}$ is the circumference of one turn, and the force points in the $+z$ direction. Summing up both sides gives the net force:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=\\sum_{i} F_{i}=\\sum_{i} 2 \\sqrt{A \\pi} I B_{i}\n$$\n\nTake out the factor $I$ from the summation and insert 1 written in the unusual way $(\\ell / N) \\cdot(N / \\ell)$ :\n\n$$\nF_{1}=I \\frac{N}{\\ell} \\sum_{i} 2 \\sqrt{A \\pi} \\frac{\\ell}{N} B_{i}\n$$\n\nThe sum on the right hand side is the flux escaping through the side of the solenoid, which equals $\\Phi_{i n}$, so the force:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=I \\frac{N}{\\ell} \\Phi_{\\text {in }}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} A N I}{2 R r \\ell}\n$$",
            "The force acting on a current loop of magnetic moment $\\vec{m}$ placed in magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given by $\\vec{\\nabla}(\\vec{m} \\cdot \\vec{B})$. Divide the solenoid into short circular coils of equal length $\\Delta \\ell$, then the magnetic moment of each short coil is\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\vec{m}=I A \\frac{N \\Delta \\ell}{\\ell} \\vec{e}_{z}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{e}_{z}$ denotes the unit vector in $z$-direction. This magnetic moment is parallel to the field $\\vec{B}_{\\text {loop }}$ created by the large current-carrying loop, so the force acting on each short segment of the solenoid in $z$-direction can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta F_{1}=\\Delta m \\frac{\\mathrm{d} B_{\\text {loop }}}{\\mathrm{d} z}=I A \\frac{N \\Delta \\ell}{\\ell} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} B_{\\text {loop }}}{\\mathrm{d} z}\n$$\n\nThe total force on the solenoid can be determined from integration of the force contributions along the solenoid:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=\\int_{-\\ell}^{0} \\mathrm{~d} \\ell \\frac{\\Delta F_{1}}{\\Delta \\ell}=I A \\frac{N}{\\ell}\\left(B_{\\text {loop }}(0)-B_{\\text {loop }}(-\\ell)\\right) .\n$$\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart-law we can compute the magnetic field $B_{\\text {loop }}(z)$ of the current-carrying loop along the $z$-axis to\n\n$$\nB_{\\text {loop }}(z)=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E}}{2 R} \\frac{r^{2}}{\\left(z^{2}+r^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}}\n$$\n\nThis expression for $B_{\\text {loop }}$ yields\n\n$$\nF_{1}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} A N I r^{2}}{2 R \\ell}\\left(\\frac{1}{r^{3}}-\\frac{1}{\\left(\\ell^{2}+r^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}}\\right) \\stackrel{\\ell}{\\approx} r \\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} A N I}{2 \\ell R r},\n$$\n\nand $F_{1}$ is directed to $+z$. From a similar calculation we get $\\vec{F}_{2}=-\\vec{F}_{1}$.\n\n\n\nNote: Using the idea of dividing the solenoid into small segments other solutions are possible as well (e.g. considering small dipole contributions). One recurring solution of this type is to divide the solenoid into small segments of length $\\mathrm{d} z$, compute the $B$-field in $z$-direction effected by current-loop from Biot-Savart, use Gauss law to relate the radial $B$ flux through the segment to $\\mathrm{d} B / \\mathrm{d} z$. compute the force on the segment using Lorentz forces and integrate the force over the length of the solenoid. In this case the marking scheme is adapted in the second aspect, awarding $0.5 \\mathrm{p}$ for the idea of using Gauss law to find radial $B$-field",
            "In this solution we relate the force acting on the solenoid to the change in energy of the system. Investigate the case when point $O_{1}$ is located at $O$ first. Due to the same current directions, the magnetic force $\\vec{F}_{1}$ acting on the solenoid points in direction $+z$. While keeping the solenoid in equilibrium with external force $-\\vec{F}_{1}$, let it move by a small displacement $\\delta z$ in the positive $z$ direction. The work done by the external force is equal to the change in energy of the system:\n\n$$\n-\\vec{F}_{1} \\cdot \\delta \\vec{z}=-F_{1} \\delta z=\\delta E_{\\text {total }}\n$$\n\nWe should be aware of the fact that the system is not closed: there is also a battery and a current source included in the circuits. Hence, $\\delta E_{\\text {total }}$ contains the change in field energy and the change of energy of the power sources:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {total }}=\\delta E_{\\text {field }}+\\delta E_{\\text {sources }}\n$$\n\nSince the force does not depend on what kind of power supplies we have, let us replace the battery with a current source providing constant current $J=\\mathcal{E} / R$.\n\nNow we find a relation between $\\delta E_{\\text {field }}$ and $\\delta E_{\\text {sources }}$ The energy stored in the field can be expressed as\n\n$$\nE_{\\text {field }}=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} J^{2}+L_{12} I J\n$$\n\nwhere $L_{1}$ is the inductance of the solenoid, $L_{2}$ is that of the loop and $L_{12}$ is the mutual inductance of the system. Upon small displacement $\\delta z$, only the last term changes, so\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {field }}=\\delta L_{12} \\cdot I J\n$$\n\nThe small displacement results in a change of the flux enclosed by the loop and the solenoid. The flux created by the solenoid on the loop is $L_{12} I$, and the flux created by the loop through the solenoid is $L_{21} J=L_{12} J$ (here we used the symmetry property of mutual inductance). During the short time $\\delta t$ of the displacement $\\delta z$, the e.m.f. induced in the loop ( $\\left.V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {loop }}\\right)$ and the solenoid $\\left(V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {solenoid }}\\right)$ can be expressed with Faraday's law:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {loop }}=-\\frac{\\delta L_{12}}{\\delta t} I, \\quad V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {solenoid }}=-\\frac{\\delta L_{12}}{\\delta t} J .\n$$\n\nIn order to keep the current in the circuits constant, the current sources need to provide an additional power, so they give away extra energy (in addition to Joule heat). This energy change of the sources is given by:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {sources }}=\\left(V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {loop }} J+V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {solenoid }} I\\right) \\delta t\n$$\n\nUsing the previous results we finally get:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {sources }}=-2 \\delta L_{12} I J=-2 \\delta E_{\\text {field }}\n$$\n\nwhich means $\\delta E_{\\text {total }}=-\\delta E_{\\text {field }}$, and hence $F_{1} \\delta z=$ $\\delta E_{\\text {field }}=\\delta L_{12} I J$.\n\nNote 1. Naively, one might think that we get the result $\\delta E_{\\text {total }}=\\delta E_{\\text {field }}$ if we imagine superconducting wires without power supplies. One can show with detailed calculation that in that case the currents in the loop and the coil change, as the total flux enclosed by a superconducting circuit must remain constant. The correct physical justification of the appearing negative sign is an important part of the solution.\n\nNow we calculate the change in mutual inductance $\\delta L_{12}$. The small displacement $\\delta z$ can be imagined as we take a short segment from the tail $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ of the coil (consisting of $N \\delta z / \\ell$ turns) and move it to the head $O_{1}$. As a result, the flux produced by the loop on the solenoid increases by\n\n$$\n\\delta \\Phi_{12}=\\delta L_{21} J=\\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu_{0} J}{2 r}}_{\\substack{\\text { (at center) } \\\\ \\text { loop }}} A \\frac{N}{\\ell} \\delta z\n$$\n\nFrom this we get:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=\\frac{\\delta L_{12} I J}{\\delta z}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} N A I}{2 \\ell R r}\n$$\n\nIf the tail $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ of the solenoid is located at point $O$, the coefficient of mutual inductance decreases upon small displacement, which results in $\\vec{F}_{2}=-\\vec{F}_{1}$.\n\nNote 2. The field energy can be also calculated from the energy density integrated for the whole space. Instead of calculating the total field energy, it is easier to find its change using the same idea presented above, i.e. take a segment of length $\\delta z$ from the tail and move it to the head of the solenoid. Assuming $\\ell \\gg \\delta z \\gg \\sqrt{A}$, the field created by the solenoid inside that segment is $\\mu_{0} N I / \\ell$ (because the field differs from this only at distance $\\sim \\sqrt{A}$ from the ends). At the end we get the same result for the change in field energy using the expression:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {field }}=\\frac{1}{2 \\mu_{0}}\\left[\\left(B_{\\text {loop }}^{\\text {(at centre) }}+B_{\\text {sol }}\\right)^{2}-\\left(B_{\\text {loop }}^{\\text {(at centre) })}\\right)^{2}-B_{\\text {sol }}^{2}\\right] A \\delta z .\n$$\n\nNote 3. A third possibility is to calculate the potential energy change of the displaced few turns of the solenoid. The magnetic moment of a segment of length $\\delta z$ is $\\vec{m}=\\vec{e}_{z} I A N \\delta z / \\ell$, and its energy in external field is $E_{\\mathrm{pot}}=-\\vec{m} \\vec{B}$. Important to highlight that this potential energy already contains the factor of -1 discussed at the beginning of the solution, so the force acting on the solenoid can be expressed as\n\n$$\nF_{1}=-\\frac{\\delta E_{\\mathrm{pot}}}{\\delta z}\n$$\n\nThe external field is the superposition of the field $\\vec{B}_{\\text {loop }}$ created by the loop and the field $\\vec{B}_{\\text {sol }}$ created by the coil (note that this latter contains a factor of $1 / 2$ compared to the field in the middle of the solenoid). Since $\\vec{B}_{\\text {sol }}$ is the same at the two ends $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$, the energy change is:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\mathrm{pot}}=-\\vec{m} \\vec{B}_{\\text {loop }}^{\\text {(at center) }}-\\vec{m} \\vec{B}_{\\text {loop }}(z=\\ell) .\n$$\n\nThe second term can be neglected, and we get\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\mathrm{pot}}=-\\frac{I A N \\delta z}{\\ell} \\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E}}{2 R r}\n$$\n\n\n\nwhich gives the same answer for $F_{1}$ as the other ideas."

Consider a point $Q$ on the end of the thread being pulled that coincided with $P$ at the moment when it touched the cylinder. Consider motion of the thread in a system of reference (SR), which rotates at angular speed $\\omega=u / R$ around the center of the cylinder. In that SR the part of the thread in contact with the cylinder is at rest and the point $Q$ rotates around the cylinder with the angular velocity $\\omega_{Q}=-\\omega$ (see the figure).\nSince the middle part of the thread is at rest, energy of the mass $P$ is conserved. For the same reason, the velocity $v_{P}$ of $P$ is perpendicular to the thread. Therefore the kinetic energy acquired by the mass in the rotating frame is equal to the decrease of its centrifugal potential energy:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{P}^{2}=-\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} R^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} r^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} l_{P}^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $l_{P}$ is the length of the unwound part of the thread on the side of the mass $P$ (see the figure).

        "question": "## T3: Cat eyes\n\nYou may have noticed that in darkness, when a cat is within the light beam of a headlamp, its eyes appear very bright, see the photo below (left). This phenomenon can be modelled by a lens setup, see the photo on right, and the diagram beneath the photos.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_ac051a2ec661e03601f7g-1.jpg?height=690&width=928&top_left_y=484&top_left_x=1044)\n\nThe photo on right was taken by a digital single-lens reflex camera. The light intensity at the camera sensor pixels marked by a red line (in the photo) is shown in the graph below: the log base 10 of the light intensity (measured as the number of photons caught by each pixel) is plotted against the $x$-coordinate, with the pixels' side length serving as the unit length.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_ac051a2ec661e03601f7g-1.jpg?height=631&width=928&top_left_y=1489&top_left_x=1044)\n\nThe lens modelling cat eyes can be treated as an ideal thin lens of focal length $f=55 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and diameter $D=$ $39 \\mathrm{~mm}$; however, you should keep in mind that the given graph shows real measurement data, and the lens has certain non-ideal features. Most importantly, partial reflections of brightly lit areas from the lens surfaces may decrease the contrast: dark areas seen through the lens appear less dark than they actually are; this effect can be neglected for the camera lens, but not so for the lens serving as a model of a cat's eye.\n\nBased on the given data, estimate (with the accuracy of ca 20\\%) the distance $h$ between the axis of the camera and the axis of the lamp (which can be considered as a point source) if the distance of the camera from the paper sheet was $L=4.8 \\mathrm{~m}$.",
        "solution": [
            "When you look at the photo of the lens and/or the graph provided, four regions with different brightness levels can be distinguished. The brightest region represents the magnified image of the blur spot created by the lamp through the lens. The blur spot is created because the distance from the lens to the white sheet beneath it is slightly larger than the focal distance; as we can see from the graph, the blur spot is of almost constant brightness (a flat plateau at $\\log _{10} I=4.4$ ), so we can say that the entire luminous flux falling from the lamp onto the lens is distributed evenly over the blur spot. Note that the blur spot has no sharp edges, though, as you would expect from in such case. This is because the image of this bright disc is situated between the lens and the camera, and is at a fairly big distance away from the plane which is sharp at the image sensor (as seen from the photo, the camera is focused onto the lens). Because of that, the enlarged image of the blur spot has blurred edges in the photo (at the blurred edges, $\\log _{10} I$ varies from 3.4 to 4.4). The second-brightest region (with $\\log _{10} I=3.4$ ) represents the scattered light from the brightest region: in that region, we are still looking through the lens, and see the area next to the bright blur spot on the sheet. Ideally, its should be darker than the sheet seen in those places where it is not obstructed by the lens, because the lens is shading the light from the lamp. However, the glass elements of this big lens are non-ideal (and there are many glass elements inside the lens!), so the light from the lamp and the bright blur spot is scattered towards the camera giving rise to an increased apparent brightness. In the area where we see the blur spot, this light is insignificant (much weaker than the light from the blur spot), but not so in this dark area: here, the scatteredfrom-the-glass-surfaces dominates heavily over the light coming from the paper sheet. As a matter of fact, this fact could be used to improve the accuracy of the calculations: we could subtract the contribution of the scattered light $\\left(10^{3.4}\\right)$ from the total intensity of the light at the brightest spot $\\left(10^{4.4}\\right)$ to obtain the contribution coming from the blur spot on the sheet. The darkest regions (with $\\log _{10} I<1.75$ ) represent the interior black painting of the lens seen through the big front glass element of the lens, which absorbs most of the incident light, and the region with $x>420$ and $\\log _{10} I=1.95$ represents the white sheet illuminated by the lamp. The ratio between the measured light intensity of the brightest region and that of the region with $x>420$ can be utilized to find the distance of the sheet (the blur spot) from the lens to the paper sheet $d_{0}$, see below.\n\nFrom the data given in the problem text we know that $L \\gg f$; from the photo of the lens, it is also clear that $d_{0}$ is of the same order of magnitude as $f$. Because of that, the illuminance $E$ (luminous flux per unit area) near the lens can be assumed to be the same as at the paper sheet, The luminous flux per solid angle and unit area of a lightscattering (or radiating) surface is called the luminance $\\mathscr{L}$; since all these directions under which the scattered light enters the lens aperture are close to the surface nor$\\mathrm{mal}$, we may assume the luminance of the paper sheet to be constant over all these directions. With the small\n\n\n\nangle approximation, the light intensity $I$ (illuminance, luminous flux $\\Phi$ per unit area) at the camera sensor is proportional to $\\mathscr{L}$ (see Explanation 1).\n\nThe luminance of the blur spot on the sheet $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ is $1 / k$ larger than the luminance $\\mathscr{L}_{s}$ of the paper sheet, where $k$ equals the ratio between the area of the bright dot (the blur spot) on the paper sheet and the area of the lens, because all the light received by the lens is \"compressed\" into the tiny blur spot.\n\nSmall angle approximation is also used to show that luminance of the image of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{I}$ equals to the luminance of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ (see Explanation 2). Therefore, the light intensity at the sensor cells corresponding to the brightest area (where we see the image of the blur spot) $I_{I}=I_{s} / k$, where $I_{s}$ stands for the intensity at the cells corresponding to unobscured paper sheet. So, from the graph, we can deduce the value of $k$, and knowing $k$ we can calculate $d_{0}$. Let the distance along the axis between the image of the bright region through the lens and the lens itself be denoted as $d_{S}$; according to the Newton's lens formula, $\\left(d_{S}-f\\right)\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)=$ $f^{2}$. Hence,\n\n$$\nd_{S}=f+\\frac{f^{2}}{d_{0}-f}=\\frac{d_{0} f}{\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)}\n$$\n\ncan be also determined.\n\nHypothesize that $d_{0}-f \\ll f$. Let us calculate the diameter of the image of the blur spot\n\n$$\nD_{I}=\\frac{D_{B S} d_{S}}{d_{0}}=\\frac{D_{B S} f}{d_{0}-f}\n$$\n\nwhere the diameter of the blur spot on the sheet\n\n$$\nD_{B S}=\\frac{D\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\right)}{f+s} \\approx \\frac{D\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\right)}{f}\n$$\n\nand $s$ denotes the distance of the image of the point source from the focal plane. Using Newton's lens formula, $s=f^{2} /\\left(L-f-d_{0}\\right) \\approx f^{2} / L$, This leads us to\n\n$$\nD_{B S} \\approx D\\left(\\frac{d_{0}-f}{f}-\\frac{f}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nand therefore\n\n$$\nD_{I} \\approx D\\left[1-\\frac{f^{2}}{L\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)}\\right]\n$$\n\nKeeping in mind that $d_{0}-f=\\frac{d_{0} f}{d_{S}} \\approx \\frac{f^{2}}{d_{S}}$, we obtain\n\n$$\nD_{I} \\approx D\\left(1-\\frac{d_{S}}{L}\\right)=\\frac{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}{L} .\n$$\n\nThis means that as seen from the position of the camera, the angular size of the image of the blur spot $\\theta_{B S}=$ $D_{I} /\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)$ equals to the angular size of the lens aperture $\\theta_{L}=D / L$. This fact is easily confirmed from the photo and is an important observation for two reasons. First, it means that based on the angular diameter of the image of the blur spot on the photo, it is impossible to figure out the distance $d_{0}$ (and hence, $d_{S}$ ). Second, it allows us to measure instead of the angular distance $\\theta$ between the centre of the lens and the centre of the image of the blur spot (as seen from the position of the cameraline), the respective distance between the edges of the respective circles. Equality of these two angular sizes is also easily seen from the geometric construction, see the figure. Ineed, consider blue lines $S A G$ and $S B F$ which arrive from the lamp $S$ to the edges of the blur spot. Image of point $F$, denoted by $J$, is now easily found as the intersection point of the ray $S B F$ with the ray $F O$ (passing through the centre of the lens); image $H$ of the other edge of the blur spot is found in the same way. From this construction, it becomes clear that the angular size of the image of the blur spot and the lens, as seen from the camera, are exactly equal, without any approximation. Due to the smallness of the distance $h$, these angular sizes remain almost constant when the observation point is moved from $S$ to $C$.\n\nGiven the images are approximately circular, the area ratio $k$ equals $\\left(D_{B S} / D\\right)^{2}$, or\n\n$$\n\\pm \\sqrt{k}=\\frac{1}{f}\\left(d_{0}-\\frac{L f}{L-f}\\right)=\\frac{d_{0}}{f}-\\frac{L}{L-f}\n$$\n\nIn the above equation, the \\pm sign represents the two cases where the paper sheet is behind or in front of the image of the lamp. From the graph, the ratio between the intensity of the brightest region and the dark region with $x>420$ is $10^{4.4-1.95} \\approx 282$, which equals $1 / k$. Then, $d_{0} / f$ can be found to be $\\pm \\sqrt{k}+1+f / L$, which gives two solutions $d_{0} / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_{0} / f \\approx 0.95$. According to the experimental settings given in the problem text, $d_{0}$ is greater than $f$, and thus we obtain $d_{0} / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_{S} \\approx 15.03 f \\approx 83 \\mathrm{~cm}$. This also verifies the hypothesis that $d_{0}-f \\ll f$.\n\nThe centre of the image of the blur spot is positioned at the height $h^{\\prime}=h \\frac{d_{S}}{L}$ above the direction to the centre of the lens (this expression from similarity of the triangles $O Q P$ and $O C S$ ) which means that $\\theta=h^{\\prime} /\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)$; meanwhile, the angular diameter of the lens $\\theta_{L}=D / L$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{L}}=\\frac{h d_{S}}{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe ratio of the angular distances is easily measured from the figure as the ratio of the width $d_{c r}$ of the crescent-shaped second-brightest region to the diameter of the lense's aperture $D^{\\prime}$ :\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\frac{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}{d_{S}}\n$$\n\nBased on the graph, $d_{c r} \\approx 90$ pixels (midpoint of the blurry edge is around $x \\approx 120 \\mathrm{px}$, and the left edge of the aperture (in the graph) is at $x \\approx 30 \\mathrm{px}$; the right edge of the lens aperture is at $x \\approx 240 \\mathrm{px}$ corresponding to $D^{\\prime}=210 \\mathrm{px}$ and yielding $h \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm}$.\n\nRemark 1. In order to obtain the final answer with a reasonably good accuracy, it is not strictly speaking necessary to show that the apparent angular diameters of the lens and of the image of the blur spot are equal. All the other calculations remain the same, just one needs to match a circle with the circular segment of the visible edge of the blur spot, and measure directly $h^{\\prime}$, the distance between the centre of the lens and the centre of the blur spot, together with the diameter of the lens aperture $D^{\\prime}$ (see the small figure).\n\nRemark 2. The width of the crescent-shaped secondbrightest area can be also measured from the photo of\n\n\n\nthe lens with the required accuracy; however, measuring in pixels from the graph is more accurate.\n\nExplanation 1: Consider a small light source of luminance $\\mathcal{L}$ and surface area $S$ at a large distance $\\uparrow$ from the camera. The illuminance (the luminous flux per unit area) at the position of the camera is proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$ and so is the total luminous flux received by the whole sensor. Meanwhile, all this light energy is focused onto a small area $S^{\\prime}$ on the sensor - onto the image of the light source, and this area is also proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$. Therefore, the illuminance $I$ at the position of those sensor pixels which are covered by the image is independent of the distance $\\uparrow$.\n\nExplanation 2: Consider a very narrow cone of light of solid angle $\\omega$, starting from a very small area $S$ at the blur spot in a direction close to the surface normal, and carrying a total luminous flux $\\Phi$. Since the cone is narrow, this light beam is entirely caught by the lens at distance $d_{0}$, and focused onto the image of surface area $S^{\\prime}=S\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\right)^{2}$ at distance $d_{S}$ from the lens. The light rays of this beam traverse the focus and form another light cone of solid angle $\\omega^{\\prime}$ departing from the image. It is easy to see from similar triangles that $\\omega / \\omega^{\\prime}=\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\right)^{2}$. Then, the luminance of the image $\\mathcal{L}_{I}=\\Phi /\\left(S^{\\prime} \\omega^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Phi /(S \\omega)$, i.e. equal to the luminance of the blur spot.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_5c3bc2296f9c6fb2e76fg-1.jpg?height=865&width=928&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=1044)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_21_5c3bc2296f9c6fb2e76fg-1.jpg?height=757&width=1879&top_left_y=1226&top_left_x=91)\n\nRemark 3: After having derived Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 and calculated $d_{0}$, the geometrical optics aspect can also be tackled by considering the image of the camera through the lens. The region bounded by the darkest ring in the image represents the area on the paper sheet that is observable by the camera through the lens. This area can be approximated by a circular spot with diameter $d$ (represented by $D^{\\prime}$ in the graph) depending negligibly on the size of the lens of the camera. Given small angles and that the lamp and the camera have equal distances to the lens, the bright spot on the paper sheet also has a diameter of $d$, which means $d=D \\sqrt{k}$. The angular distance between the lamp and the camera as seen from the center of the lens is $h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)$, and therefore, the distances between the two spots' centers, and also thus their boundaries (represented by $d_{c r}$ in the graph), on the paper sheet are $d_{0} h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)$. We then obtain an equivalent equation to that above:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d_{0} h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)}{D \\sqrt{k}}=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\Leftrightarrow h=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} D \\sqrt{k} \\frac{L-d_{0}}{d_{0}} \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm} .\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that, compared to the original analysis, the deviation in this calculation caused by $f / L$ (in finding $d_{0}$ and $d_{S}$ ) on the final result reduces drastically (from approximately $20 \\%$ down to approximately $1 \\%$ ). Even if $d_{0} \\approx f$ is assumed, the result is only deviated by approximately $7 \\%$."

We may notice that since $s /(S-s)=50$, the speed $v_{2}$ of the liquid in the narrow gap is 50 times larger than the typical speed of the liquid below the cylinder (which can be estimated to be in the range of $v_{1}$ ). And while the mass of the liquid below the cylinder is much larger than the mass of liquid inside the gap (the ratio is ca. 25 if the „few centimeters\" in the problem text is taken to be $3.5 \\mathrm{~cm}$ ), the kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity, so the kinetic energy of the liquid inside the gap is roughly 100 times larger than the kinetic energy of the liquid below the cylinder.\n\nSince the kinetic energy of the liquid below the cylinder is negligible, we can write the total kinetic energy of the system as:\n\n$$\nE_{\\text {kin }}=\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} \\gamma \\varrho s h v_{1}^{2}}_{\\text {cylinder }}+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} \\varrho(S-s)\\left(\\gamma h+x_{1}+x_{2}\\right) v_{2}^{2}}_{\\text {liquid }} .\n$$\n\nHere $x_{1}, x_{2} \\ll \\gamma h$, so we shall keep only the term containing $\\gamma h$ in the second bracket:\n\n$$\nE_{\\text {kin }}=\\frac{1}{2} \\gamma \\varrho s h v_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} \\varrho(S-s) \\gamma h v_{2}^{2}\n$$\n\nExpressing $v_{2}$ from continuity law gives the following:\n\n$$\nE_{\\text {kin }}=\\frac{1}{2} \\gamma \\varrho s h v_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} \\varrho \\gamma h \\frac{s^{2}}{S-s} v_{1}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} \\varrho \\gamma h \\frac{s S}{S-s} v_{1}^{2} .\n$$\n\nThe potential and kinetic energies can be written in the form\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{pot}}=\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eff}} x_{1}^{2}, \\quad E_{\\mathrm{kin}}=\\frac{1}{2} m_{\\mathrm{eff}} v_{1}^{2},\n$$\n\nwhere the effective spring constant and effective mass are given by\n\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\varrho \\frac{s S}{S-s} g, \\quad m_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\varrho \\gamma h \\frac{s S}{S-s}\n$$\n\nSo the oscillation is indeed harmonic, thus the angular frequency and the period are:\n\n$$\n\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{\\gamma h}}, \\quad T=2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma h}{g}}=0.53 \\mathrm{~s} .\n$$\n\nNote.

Find, as precisely as possible, the temperature of the droplet at ground level if there were no inversion and the temperature profile followed the dashed line below a height of $2 \\mathrm{~km}$.\nNeglect evaporation, condensation and size changes of the droplet. Assume that water and ice have very high thermal conductivity and that the density of the atmosphere is constant with height.\n\nUse $c_{\\text {water }}=4.2 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~kg}^{-1} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ for the the specific heat of water and $c_{\\text {ice }}=2.1 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~kg}^{-1} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ for that of ice.

        "solution": [
            "If the temperature profile follows the dashed line the droplet will completely melt and the heat transferred from the atmosphere will heat it up. Since the latent heat of melting is much bigger than the specific heat of water times some degrees of temperature variation the temperature of the liquid droplet will closely follow the temperature of the atmosphere eventually. Its temperature at ground level should therefore be close to $8{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFor a better estimate let us introduce a new coordinate $x$ whose origin is at the height, where the droplet is completely molten (somewhat higher than $\\left.h_{\\mathrm{B}}\\right)$, and which is oriented downwards. For the change in temperature of the droplet we then have\n\n$$\nm c_{\\text {water }} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} T_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathrm{d} t}=m c_{\\text {water }} v \\frac{\\mathrm{d} T_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathrm{d} x}=\\kappa\\left(T-T_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right), \\tag{5}\n$$\n\nwhere the temperature of the atmosphere is given by $T(x)=T(x=0)+2.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{Ckm}^{-1} x=: T(x=0)+b x$.\nFor the difference $\\Delta T=T-T_{\\mathrm{d}}$ between the atmospheric temperature and the droplet temperature we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\Delta T}{\\mathrm{~d} x}=b-\\frac{\\mathrm{d} T_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathrm{d} x}=b-\\frac{\\kappa}{m c_{\\text {water }} v} \\Delta T . \\tag{6}\n$$\n\nThis differential equation is solved by\n\n$$\n\\Delta T=b x_{0}+\\text { const } \\cdot \\exp \\left(-x / x_{0}\\right), \\tag{7}\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{0}=m c_{\\text {water }} v / \\kappa$. From equation (2) we find that $\\frac{m v}{\\kappa}=\\frac{A}{L}$ such that $x_{0}=\\frac{c_{\\text {water }}}{L} A \\approx 0.063 \\mathrm{~km}$. Therefore the exponential factor in the above equation is negligible at ground level (the constant is close to $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and we arrive at a temperature difference between the droplet temperature and the atmospheric temperature at ground level of\n\n$$\n\\Delta T \\approx 0.13^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, \\quad \\text { and therefore } \\quad T_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 7.9^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\text {. } \\tag{8}\n$$\n\nAnother phenomenon, which effectively shifts atmosphere temperature as it is \"felt\" by the droplet is due to viscous dissipation. It can be estimated by equating the droplet potential energy loss rate $m g v$ to thermal power carried away by the circumfluent air $\\kappa \\Delta T^{*}$. This gives $\\Delta T^{*} \\sim m g v / \\kappa=g A / L=0.17^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.
